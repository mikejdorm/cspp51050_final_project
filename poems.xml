		<title>A Step Away from Them</title>
		<poem_text>It’s my lunch hour, so I go 
for a walk among the hum-colored   
cabs. First, down the sidewalk   
where laborers feed their dirty   
glistening torsos sandwiches 
and Coca-Cola, with yellow helmets   
on. They protect them from falling   
bricks, I guess. Then onto the   
avenue where skirts are flipping   
above heels and blow up over   
grates. The sun is hot, but the   
cabs stir up the air. I look   
at bargains in wristwatches. There   
are cats playing in sawdust. 
                                          On 
to Times Square, where the sign 
blows smoke over my head, and higher   
the waterfall pours lightly. A   
Negro stands in a doorway with a   
toothpick, languorously agitating.   
A blonde chorus girl clicks: he   
smiles and rubs his chin. Everything   
suddenly honks: it is 12:40 of   
a Thursday. 
                Neon in daylight is a   
great pleasure, as Edwin Denby would   
write, as are light bulbs in daylight.   
I stop for a cheeseburger at JULIET’S   
CORNER. Giulietta Masina, wife of   
Federico Fellini, è bell’ attrice. 
And chocolate malted. A lady in   
foxes on such a day puts her poodle   
in a cab. 
             There are several Puerto   
Ricans on the avenue today, which   
makes it beautiful and warm. First   
Bunny died, then John Latouche,   
then Jackson Pollock. But is the   
earth as full as life was full, of them?   
And one has eaten and one walks,   
past the magazines with nudes   
and the posters for BULLFIGHT and   
the Manhattan Storage Warehouse,   
which they’ll soon tear down. I   
used to think they had the Armory   
Show there. 
                A glass of papaya juice   
and back to work. My heart is in my   
pocket, it is Poems by Pierre Reverdy.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Mothers of America 
                                     let your kids go to the movies! 
get them out of the house so they won’t know what you’re up to   
it’s true that fresh air is good for the body 
                                                                             but what about the soul   
that grows in darkness, embossed by silvery images 
and when you grow old as grow old you must 
                                                                            they won’t hate you   
they won’t criticize you they won’t know 
                                                                            they’ll be in some glamorous country   
they first saw on a Saturday afternoon or playing hookey 
they may even be grateful to you 
                                                            for their first sexual experience   
which only cost you a quarter 
                                                       and didn’t upset the peaceful home   
they will know where candy bars come from 
                                                                                 and gratuitous bags of popcorn   
as gratuitous as leaving the movie before it’s over 
with a pleasant stranger whose apartment is in the Heaven on Earth Bldg   
near the Williamsburg Bridge 
                                                       oh mothers you will have made the little tykes 
so happy because if nobody does pick them up in the movies   
they won’t know the difference 
                                                         and if somebody does it’ll be sheer gravy   
and they’ll have been truly entertained either way 
instead of hanging around the yard 
                                                                 or up in their room 
                                                                                                     hating you 
prematurely since you won’t have done anything horribly mean yet   
except keeping them from the darker joys 
                                                                             it’s unforgivable the latter   
so don’t blame me if you won’t take this advice 
                                                                                      and the family breaks up   
and your children grow old and blind in front of a TV set 
                                                                                                        seeing   
movies you wouldn’t let them see when they were young</poem_text>

		<title>Chez Jane</title>
		<poem_text>The white chocolate jar full of petals 
swills odds and ends around in a dizzying eye   
of four o’clocks now and to come. The tiger,   
marvellously striped and irritable, leaps   
on the table and without disturbing a hair   
of the flowers’ breathless attention, pisses   
into the pot, right down its delicate spout. 
A whisper of steam goes up from that porcelain   
urethra. “Saint-Saëns!” it seems to be whispering,   
curling unerringly around the furry nuts   
of the terrible puss, who is mentally flexing.   
Ah be with me always, spirit of noisy   
contemplation in the studio, the Garden   
of Zoos, the eternally fixed afternoons!   
There, while music scratches its scrofulous   
stomach, the brute beast emerges and stands,   
clear and careful, knowing always the exact peril   
at this moment caressing his fangs with   
a tongue given wholly to luxurious usages;   
which only a moment before dropped aspirin   
in this sunset of roses, and now throws a chair   
in the air to aggravate the truly menacing.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>1
My heart’s aflutter!
I am standing in the bath tub
crying. Mother, mother
who am I? If he
will just come back once
and kiss me on the face
his coarse hair brush
my temple, it’s throbbing!
then I can put on my clothes
I guess, and walk the streets.
2
I love you. I love you,
but I’m turning to my verses
and my heart is closing
like a fist.
Words! be
sick as I am sick, swoon,
roll back your eyes, a pool,
and I’ll stare down
at my wounded beauty
which at best is only a talent
for poetry.
Cannot please, cannot charm or win
what a poet!
and the clear water is thick
with bloody blows on its head.
I embrace a cloud,
but when I soared
it rained.
3
That’s funny! there’s blood on my chest
oh yes, I’ve been carrying bricks
what a funny place to rupture!
and now it is raining on the ailanthus
as I step out onto the window ledge
the tracks below me are smoky and
glistening with a passion for running
I leap into the leaves, green like the sea
4
Now I am quietly waiting for 
the catastrophe of my personality
to seem beautiful again,
and interesting, and modern.
The country is grey and
brown and white in trees,
snows and skies of laughter
always diminishing, less funny
not just darker, not just grey.
It may be the coldest day of
the year, what does he think of
that? I mean, what do I? And if I do,
perhaps I am myself again.</poem_text>

		<title>Meditations in an Emergency</title>
		<poem_text>          Am I to become profligate as if I were a blonde? Or religious as if I were French?           Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous (and how the same names keep recurring on that interminable list!), but one of these days there’ll be nothing left with which to venture forth.           Why should I share you? Why don’t you get rid of someone else for a change?           I am the least difficult of men. All I want is boundless love.           Even trees understand me! Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don’t I? I’m just like a pile of leaves.           However, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nostalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures. No. One need never leave the confines of New York to get all the greenery one wishes—I can’t even enjoy a blade of grass unless I know there’s a subway handy, or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally regret life. It is more important to affirm the least sincere; the clouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass. Do they know what they’re missing? Uh huh.           My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscriminate but fleeting, entirely specific and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. I am always looking away. Or again at something after it has given me up. It makes me restless and that makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them still. If only I had grey, green, black, brown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something. It’s not that I am curious. On the contrary, I am bored but it’s my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as the sky must be above the earth. And lately, so great has their anxiety become, I can spare myself little sleep.           Now there is only one man I love to kiss when he is unshaven. Heterosexuality! you are inexorably approaching. (How discourage her?)           St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in Dostoevsky. How am I to become a legend, my dear? I’ve tried love, but that hides you in the bosom of another and I am always springing forth from it like the lotus—the ecstasy of always bursting forth! (but one must not be distracted by it!) or like a hyacinth, “to keep the filth of life away,” yes, there, even in the heart, where the filth is pumped in and courses and slanders and pollutes and determines. I will my will, though I may become famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.           Destroy yourself, if you don’t know!           It is easy to be beautiful; it is difficult to appear so. I admire you, beloved, for the trap you’ve set. It&#39;s like a final chapter no one reads because the plot is over.           “Fanny Brown is run away—scampered off with a Cornet of Horse; I do love that little Minx, &amp; hope She may be happy, tho’ She has vexed me by this Exploit a little too. —Poor silly Cecchina! or F:B: as we used to call her. —I wish She had a good Whipping and 10,000 pounds.” —Mrs. Thrale.        I’ve got to get out of here. I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans. I’ll be back, I&#39;ll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don’t want me to go where you go, so I go where you don’t want me to. It’s only afternoon, there’s a lot ahead. There won’t be any mail downstairs. Turning, I spit in the lock and the knob turns.</poem_text>

		<title>Poem (At night Chinamen jump)</title>
		<poem_text>At night Chinamen jump   
on Asia with a thump 
while in our willful way   
we, in secret, play 
affectionate games and bruise   
our knees like China’s shoes. 
The birds push apples through   
grass the moon turns blue, 
these apples roll beneath   
our buttocks like a heath 
full of Chinese thrushes   
flushed from China’s bushes. 
As we love at night   
birds sing out of sight, 
Chinese rhythms beat   
through us in our heat, 
the apples and the birds   
move us like soft words, 
we couple in the grace   
of that mysterious race.</poem_text>

		<title>Poem [“The eager note on my door said, ‘Call me,’”]</title>
		<poem_text>The eager note on my door said “Call me,   
call when you get in!” so I quickly threw   
a few tangerines into my overnight bag,   
straightened my eyelids and shoulders, and 
headed straight for the door. It was autumn   
by the time I got around the corner, oh all 
unwilling to be either pertinent or bemused, but   
the leaves were brighter than grass on the sidewalk! 
Funny, I thought, that the lights are on this late   
and the hall door open; still up at this hour, a   
champion jai-alai player like himself? Oh fie!   
for shame! What a host, so zealous! And he was 
there in the hall, flat on a sheet of blood that 
ran down the stairs. I did appreciate it. There are few   
hosts who so thoroughly prepare to greet a guest   
only casually invited, and that several months ago.</poem_text>

		<title>Rhapsody</title>
		<poem_text>515 Madison Avenue   
door to heaven? portal 
stopped realities and eternal licentiousness 
or at least the jungle of impossible eagerness 
your marble is bronze and your lianas elevator cables   
swinging from the myth of ascending 
I would join 
or declining the challenge of racial attractions 
they zing on (into the lynch, dear friends) 
while everywhere love is breathing draftily 
like a doorway linking 53rd with 54th 
the east-bound with the west-bound traffic by 8,000,000s   
o midtown tunnels and the tunnels, too, of Holland 
where is the summit where all aims are clear   
the pin-point light upon a fear of lust 
as agony’s needlework grows up around the unicorn   
and fences him for milk- and yoghurt-work 
when I see Gianni I know he’s thinking of John Ericson   
playing the Rachmaninoff 2nd or Elizabeth Taylor   
taking sleeping-pills and Jane thinks of Manderley   
and Irkutsk while I cough lightly in the smog of desire   
and my eyes water achingly imitating the true blue 
a sight of Manahatta in the towering needle 
multi-faceted insight of the fly in the stringless labyrinth   
Canada plans a higher place than the Empire State Building   
I am getting into a cab at 9th Street and 1st Avenue   
and the Negro driver tells me about a $120 apartment   
“where you can’t walk across the floor after 10 at night   
not even to pee, cause it keeps them awake downstairs” 
no, I don’t like that “well, I didn’t take it” 
perfect in the hot humid morning on my way to work   
a little supper-club conversation for the mill of the gods 
you were there always and you know all about these things   
as indifferent as an encyclopedia with your calm brown eyes   
it isn’t enough to smile when you run the gauntlet 
you’ve got to spit like Niagara Falls on everybody or 
Victoria Falls or at least the beautiful urban fountains of Madrid   
as the Niger joins the Gulf of Guinea near the Menemsha Bar 
that is what you learn in the early morning passing Madison Avenue   
where you’ve never spent any time and stores eat up light 
I have always wanted to be near it 
though the day is long (and I don’t mean Madison Avenue)   
lying in a hammock on St. Mark’s Place sorting my poems   
in the rancid nourishment of this mountainous island   
they are coming and we holy ones must go 
is Tibet historically a part of China? as I historically   
belong to the enormous bliss of American death</poem_text>

		<title>The Day Lady Died</title>
		<poem_text>It is 12:20 in New York a Friday 
three days after Bastille day, yes 
it is 1959 and I go get a shoeshine 
because I will get off the 4:19 in Easthampton   
at 7:15 and then go straight to dinner 
and I don’t know the people who will feed me 
I walk up the muggy street beginning to sun   
and have a hamburger and a malted and buy 
an ugly NEW WORLD WRITING to see what the poets   
in Ghana are doing these days 
                                           I go on to the bank 
and Miss Stillwagon (first name Linda I once heard)   
doesn’t even look up my balance for once in her life   
and in the GOLDEN GRIFFIN I get a little Verlaine   
for Patsy with drawings by Bonnard although I do   
think of Hesiod, trans. Richmond Lattimore or   
Brendan Behan’s new play or Le Balcon or Les Nègres 
of Genet, but I don’t, I stick with Verlaine 
after practically going to sleep with quandariness 
and for Mike I just stroll into the PARK LANE 
Liquor Store and ask for a bottle of Strega and   
then I go back where I came from to 6th Avenue   
and the tobacconist in the Ziegfeld Theatre and   
casually ask for a carton of Gauloises and a carton 
of Picayunes, and a NEW YORK POST with her face on it 
and I am sweating a lot by now and thinking of 
leaning on the john door in the 5 SPOT 
while she whispered a song along the keyboard 
to Mal Waldron and everyone and I stopped breathing</poem_text>

		<poem_text>I wanted to be sure to reach you; 
though my ship was on the way it got caught   
in some moorings. I am always tying up   
and then deciding to depart. In storms and   
at sunset, with the metallic coils of the tide   
around my fathomless arms, I am unable   
to understand the forms of my vanity   
or I am hard alee with my Polish rudder   
in my hand and the sun sinking. To   
you I offer my hull and the tattered cordage   
of my will. The terrible channels where   
the wind drives me against the brown lips   
of the reeds are not all behind me. Yet   
I trust the sanity of my vessel; and   
if it sinks, it may well be in answer   
to the reasoning of the eternal voices, 
the waves which have kept me from reaching you.</poem_text>

		<title>from The Rape of Lucrece</title>
		<poem_text>Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under, 
Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;
Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,
Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
Between whose hills her head entombed is;
    Where like a virtuous monument she lies,
    To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes.
Without the bed her other fair hand was,
On the green coverlet, whose perfect white
Showed like an April daisy on the grass,
With pearly sweat resembling dew of night.
Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,
    And canopied in darkness sweetly lay
    Till they might open to adorn the day.
Her hair like golden threads played with her breath
O modest wantons, wanton modesty!
Showing life’s triumph in the map of death,
And death’s dim look in life’s mortality.
Each in her sleep themselves so beautify
    As if between them twain there were no strife,
    But that life lived in death, and death in life.
Her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue,
A pair of maiden worlds unconquerèd,
Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,
And him by oath they truly honourèd.
These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred,
    Who like a foul usurper went about
    From this fair throne to heave the owner out.
What could he see but mightily he noted?
What did he note but strongly he desired?
What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,
And in his will his willful eye he tired.
With more than admiration he admired
    Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,
    Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.
As the grim lion fawneth o’er his prey
Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,
So o’er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,
His rage of lust by gazing qualified;
Slacked, not suppressed; for, standing by her side,
    His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
    Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins.
And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,
Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting.
In bloody death and ravishment delighting,
Nor children’s tears nor mothers’ groans respecting,
Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting.
    Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,
    Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.
His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,
His eye commends the leading to his hand;
His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
Smoking with pride, marched on to make his stand
On her bare breast, the heart of all her land,
    Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,
    Left their round turrets destitute and pale.
They, mustering to the quiet cabinet
Where their dear governess and lady lies,
Do tell her she is dreadfully beset
And fright her with confusion of their cries.
She, much amazed, breaks ope her locked-up eyes,
    Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,
    Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled.
Imagine her as one in dead of night
From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,
That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,
Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking.
What terror ‘tis! but she, in worser taking,
    From sleep disturbèd, heedfully doth view
    The sight which makes supposèd terror true.
Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears,
Like to a new-killed bird she trembling lies.
She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears
Quick-shifting antics ugly in her eyes.
Such shadows are the weak brain’s forgeries,
    Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,
    In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.
His hand, that yet remains upon her breast
(Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!)
May feel her heart (poor citizen) distressed,
Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,
Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.
    This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,
    To make the breach and enter this sweet city.</poem_text>

		<name> William  Shakespeare</name>
		<title>from Venus and Adonis</title>
		<poem_text>Even as the sunne with purple-colourd face, 
Had tane his last leaue of the weeping morne, 
Rose-cheekt Adonis hied him to the chace, 
Hunting he lou&#39;d, but loue he laught to scorne, 
      Sick-thoughted Venus makes amaine vnto him, 
      And like a bold fac&#39;d suter ginnes to woo him. 
Thrise fairer then my selfe, (thus she began) 
The fields chiefe flower, sweete aboue compare, 
Staine to all Nimphs, more louely then a man, 
More white, and red, then doues, or roses are: 
      Nature that made thee with her selfe at strife, 
      Saith that the world hath ending with thy life. 
Vouchsafe thou wonder to alight thy steed, 
And raine his proud head to the saddle bow, 
If thou wilt daine this fauor, for thy meed 
A thousand honie secrets shalt thou know: 
      Here come and sit, where neuer serpent hisses, 
      And being set, Ile smother thee with kisses. 
And yet not cloy thy lips with loth&#39;d sacietie, 
But rather famish them amid their plentie, 
Making them red, and pale, with fresh varietie: 
Ten kisses short as one, one long as twentie: 
      A sommers day will seeme an houre but short, 
      Being wasted in such time beguiling sport. 
With this she ceazeth on his sweating palme, 
The president of pith, and liuelyhood, 
And trembling in her passion, calls it balme, 
Earths soueraigne salue, to do a goddesse good, 
      Being so enrag&#39;d, desire doth lend her force, 
      Couragiously to plucke him from his horse. 
Ouer one arme the lusty coursers raine, 
Vnder her other was the tender boy, 
Who blusht, and powted in a dull disdaine, 
With leaden appetite, vnapt to toy, 
      She red, and hot, as coles of glowing fire, 
      He red for shame, but frostie in desire. 
The studded bridle on a ragged bough, 
Nimblie she fastens, (ô how quicke is loue!) 
The steed is stalled vp, and euen now, 
To tie the rider she begins to proue: 
      Backward she pusht him, as she would be thrust, 
      And gouernd him in strength though not in lust. 
So soone was she along, as he was downe, 
Each leaning on their elbowes and their hips: 
Now doth she stroke his cheek; now doth he frown, 
And gins to chide, but soone she stops his lips, 
      And kissing speaks, with lust-full language broke, 
      If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall neuer open. 
He burnes with bashfull shame, she with her teares 
Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheekes, 
Then with her windie sighes, and golden heares, 
To fan, and blow them dry againe she seekes. 
      He saith, she is immodest, blames her misse, 
      What followes more, she murthers with a kisse. 
Euen as an emptie Eagle sharpe by fast, 
Tires with her beake on feather, flesh, and bone, 
Shaking her wings deuouring all in hast, 
Till either gorge be stuft, or pray be gone: 
      Euen so she kist his brow, his cheeke, his chin, 
      And where she ends, she doth anew begin. 
Forst to content, but neuer to obey, 
Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face; 
She feedeth on the steame, as on a pray, 
And calls it heauenly moisture, aire of grace, 
      Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers, 
      So they were dew&#39;d with such distilling showers. 
Looke how a bird lyes tangled in a net, 
So fastned in her armes Adonis lyes, 
Pure shame and aw&#39;d resistance made him fret, 
Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes: 
      Raine added to a riuer that is ranke, 
      Perforce will force it ouerflow the banke. 
Still shee intreats, and prettily intreats, 
For to a pretty eare she tunes her tale. 
Still is he sullein, still he lowres and frets, 
Twixt crimson shame, and anger ashie pale, 
      Being red she loues him best, and being white, 
      Her best is betterd with a more delight. 
Looke how he can, she cannot chuse but loue, 
And by her faire immortall hand she sweares, 
From his soft bosome neuer to remoue, 
Till he take truce with her contending teares, 
      Which log haue raind, making her cheeks all wet, 
      And one sweet kisse shal pay this comptlesse debt. 
Vpon this promise did he raise his chin, 
Like a diuedapper peering through a waue, 
Who being lookt on, ducks as quickly in: 
So offers he to giue what she did craue, 
      But when her lips were ready for his pay, 
      He winks, and turnes his lips another way. 
Neuer did passenger in sommers heat, 
More thirst for drinke, then she for this good turne, 
Her helpe she sees, but helpe she cannot get, 
She bathes in water, yet her fire must burne: 
      Oh pitty gan she crie, flint hearted boy, 
      Tis but a kisse I begge, why art thou coy? 
I haue beene wooed as I intreat thee now, 
Euen by the sterne, and direfull God of warre, 
Whose sinowie necke in battell nere did bow, 
Who conquers where he comes in euery iarre, 
      Yet hath he beene my captiue, and my slaue, 
      And begd for that which thou vnaskt shalt haue. 
Ouer my Altars hath he hong his launce, 
His battred shield, his vncontrolled crest, 
And for my sake hath learnd to sport, and daunce, 
To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and iest, 
      Scorning his churlish drumme, and ensigne red, 
      Making my armes his field, his tent my bed. 
Thus he that ouer-ruld, I ouer-swayed, 
Leading him prisoner in a red rose chaine, 
Strong temperd steele his stronger strength obaied. 
Yet was he seruile to my coy disdaine, 
      Oh be not proud, nor brag not of thy might, 
      For maistring her that foyld the God offight. 
Touch but my lips with those faire lips of thine, 
Though mine be not so faire, yet are they red, 
The kisse shalbe thine owne as well as mine, 
What seest thou in the ground? hold vp thy head, 
      Looke in mine eie-bals, there thy beauty lyes, 
      Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes? 
Art thou asham&#39;d to kisse? then winke againe, 
And I will winke, so shall the day seeme night. 
Loue keepes his reuels where there be but twaine: 
Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight, 
      These blew-veind violets whereon we leane, 
      Neuer can blab, nor know not what we meane. 
The tender spring vpon thy tempting lip, 
Shewes thee vnripe; yet maist thou well be tasted, 
Make vse of time, let not aduantage slip, 
Beauty within it selfe should not be wasted, 
      Faire flowers that are not gathred in their prime, 
      Rot, and consume themselues in little time. 
Were I hard-fauourd, foule, or wrinckled old, 
Il-nurtur&#39;d, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice, 
Ore-worne, despised, reumatique, and cold, 
Thicke-sighted, barren, leane, and lacking iuyce; 
      The mightst thou pause, for the I were not for thee, 
      But hauing no defects, why doest abhor me? 
Thou canst not see one wrinckle in my brow, 
Mine eyes are grey, and bright, &amp; quicke in turning: 
My beautie as the spring doth yearelie grow, 
My flesh is soft, and plumpe, my marrow burning, 
      My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt, 
      Would in thy palme dissolue, or seeme to melt. 
Bid me discourse, I will inchaunt thine eare, 
Or like a Fairie, trip vpon the greene, 
Or like a Nimph, with long disheueled heare, 
Daunce on the sands, and yet no footing seene. 
      Loue is a spirit all compact of fire, 
      Not grosse to sinke, but light, and will aspire. 
Witnesse this Primrose banke whereon I lie, 
These forceles flowers like sturdy trees support me: 
Two stregthles doues wil draw me through the skie, 
From morne till night, euen where I list to sport me. 
      Is loue so light sweet boy, and may it be, 
      That thou shouldst thinke it heauy vnto thee? 
Is thine owne heart to thine owne face affected? 
Can thy right hand ceaze loue vpon thy left? 
Then woo thy selfe, be of thy selfe reiected: 
Steale thine own freedome, &amp; complaine on theft 
      Narcissus so him selfe him selfe forsooke, 
      And died to kisse his shadow in the brooke. 
Torches are made to light, iewels to weare, 
Dainties to tast, fresh beautie for the vse, 
Herbes for their smell, and sappie plants to beare. 
Things growing to themselues, are growths abuse, 
      Seeds spring fro seeds, &amp; beauty breedeth beauty, 
      Thou wast begot, to get it is thy duty. 
Vpon the earths increase why shouldst thou feed, 
Vnlesse the earth with thy increase be fed? 
By law of nature thou art bound to breed, 
That thine may liue, when thou thy selfe art dead: 
      And so in spite of death thou doest suruiue, 
      In that thy likenesse still is left aliue. 
By this the loue-sicke Queene began to sweate, 
For where they lay the shadow had forsooke them, 
And Titan tired in the midday heate, 
With burning eye did hotly ouerlooke them, 
      Wishing Adonis had his teame to guide, 
      So he were like him, and by Venus side. 
And now Adonis with a lazie sprite, 
And with a heauy, darke, disliking eye, 
His lowring browes ore-whelming his faire sight, 
Like mistie vapors when they blot the skie, 
      Sowring his cheekes, cries, fie, no more of loue, 
      The sunne doth burne my face, I must remoue. 
Ay, me, (quoth Venus) young, and so vnkinde, 
What bare excuses mak&#39;st thou to be gon? 
Ile sigh celestiall breath, whose gentle winde, 
Shall coole the heate of this descending sun: 
      Ile make a shadow for thee of my heares, 
      If they burne too, Ile quench them with my teares. 
The sun that shines from heauen, shines but warme, 
And lo I lye betweene that sunne and thee: 
The heate I haue from thence doth litle harme, 
Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me, 
      And were I not immortall, life were done, 
      Betweene this heauenly and earthly sunne. 
Art thou obdurate, flintie, hard as steele? 
Nay more then flint, for stone at raine relenteth: 
Art thou a womans sonne and canst not feele 
What tis to loue, how want of loue tormenteth? 
      O had thy mother borne so bad a minde, 
      She had not brought forth thee, but died vnkind. 
What am I that thou shouldst contemne me this? 
Or what great danger, dwels vpon my sute? 
What were thy lips the worse for one poore kis? 
Speake faire, but speake faire words, or else be mute: 
      Giue me one kisse, Ile giue it thee againe, 
      And one for intrest, if thou wilt haue twaine. 
Fie, liuelesse picture, cold, and sencelesse stone, 
Well painted idoll, image dull, and dead, 
Statüe contenting but the eye alone, 
Thing like a man, but of no woman bred: 
      Thou art no man, though of a mans complexion, 
      For men will kisse euen by their owne direction. 
This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue, 
And swelling passion doth prouoke a pause, 
Red cheeks, and fierie eyes blaze forth her wrong: 
Being Iudge in loue, she cannot right her cause. 
      And now she weeps, &amp; now she faine would speake 
      And now her sobs do her intendments breake. 
Sometime she shakes her head, and then his hand, 
Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground; 
Sometime her armes infold him like a band, 
She would, he will not in her armes be bound: 
      And when from thence he struggles to be gone, 
      She locks her lillie fingers one in one. 
Fondling, she saith, since I haue hemd thee here 
Within the circuit of this iuorie pale, 
Ile be a parke, and thou shalt be my deare: 
Feed where thou wilt, on mountaine, or in dale; 
      Graze on my lips, and if those hils be drie, 
      Stray lower, where the pleasant fountaines lie. 
Within this limit is reliefe inough, 
Sweet bottome grasse, and high delightfull plaine, 
Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure, and rough, 
To shelter thee from tempest, and from raine: 
      Then be my deare, since I am such a parke, 
      No dog shal rowze thee, though a thousand bark. 
At this Adonis smiles as in disdaine, 
That in ech cheeke appeares a prettie dimple; 
Loue made those hollowes, if himselfe were slaine, 
He might be buried in a tombe so simple, 
      Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie, 
      Why there loue liu&#39;d, &amp; there he could not die. 
These louely caues, these round inchanting pits, 
Opend their mouthes to swallow Venus liking: 
Being mad before, how doth she now for wits? 
Strucke dead at first, what needs a second striking? 
      Poore Queene of Ioue, in thine own law forlorne, 
      To loue a cheeke that smiles at thee in scorne. 
Now which way shall she turne? what shall she say? 
Her wordes are done, her woes the more increasing, 
The time is spent, her obiect will away, 
And from her twining armes doth vrge releasing: 
      Pitie she cries, some fauour, some remorse, 
      Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse. 
But loe from forth a copp&#39;s that neighbors by, 
A breeding Ienner, lusty, young, and proud, 
Adonis trampling Courser doth espie: 
And forth she rushes, snorts, and neighs aloud. 
      The strong-neckt steed being tied vnto a tree, 
      Breaketh his raine, and to her straight goes he. 
Imperiously he leapes, he neighs, he bounds, 
And now his wouen girths he breakes asunder, 
The bearing earth with his hard hoofe he wounds, 
Whose hollow womb resounds like heauens thunder, 
      The iron bit he crusheth tweene hir teeth, 
      Controlling what he was controlled with. 
His eares vp prickt, his braided hanging maine, 
Vpon his compast crest now stand on end, 
His nostrils drinke the aire, and forth againe 
As from a fornace, vapors doth he send: 
      His eye which scornefully glisters like fire, 
      Shewes his hote courage, and his high desire. 
Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps, 
With gentle maiestie, and modest pride, 
Anon he reres vpright, curuets, and leaps, 
As who should saie, loe thus my strength is tride. 
      And this I do to captiuate the eye, 
      Of the faire breeder that is standing by. 
What recketh he his riders angry sturre, 
His flattering holla, or his stand, I say, 
What cares he now, for curbe, or pricking spurre, 
For rich caparisons, or trappings gay: 
      He sees his loue, and nothing else he sees, 
      For nothing else with his proud sight agrees. 
Looke when a Painter would surpasse the life, 
In limming out a well-proportioned steed, 
His Art with Natures workmanship at strife, 
As if the dead the liuing should exceed: 
      So did this Horse excell a common one, 
      In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone. 
Round hooft, short ioynted, fetlocks shag, and long, 
Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostrill wide, 
High crest, short eares, straight legs, &amp; passing strog, 
Thin mane, thicke taile, broad buttock, tender hide: 
      Looke what a Horse should haue, he did not lacke, 
      Saue a proud rider on so proud a backe. 
Sometime he scuds farre off, and there he stares, 
Anon he starts, at sturring of a feather: 
To bid the wind a base he now prepares, 
And where he runne, or flie, they know not whether: 
      For through his mane, &amp; taile, the high wind sings, 
      Fanning the haires, who waue like feathred wings. 
He lookes vpon his loue, and neighes vnto her, 
She answers him, as if she knew his minde, 
Being proud as females are, to see him woo her, 
She puts on outward strangenesse, seemes vnkinde: 
      Spurnes at his loue, and scorns the heat he feeles, 
      Beating his kind imbracements with her heeles. 
Then like a melancholy malcontent, 
He vailes his taile that like a falling plume, 
Coole shadow to his melting buttocke lent, 
He stampes, and bites the poore flies in his fume: 
      His loue perceiuing how he was inrag&#39;d, 
      Grew kinder, and his furie was asswag&#39;d. 
His testie maister goeth about to take him, 
When lo the vnbackt breeder full of feare, 
Iealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him, 
With her the Horse, and left Adonis there: 
      As they were mad vnto the wood they hie them, 
      Outstripping crowes, that striue to ouerfly them. 
All swolne with chafing, downe Adonis sits, 
Banning his boystrous, and vnruly beast; 
And now the happie season once more fits 
That louesicke loue, by pleading may be blest: 
      For louers say, the heart hath treble wrong, 
      When it is bard the aydance of the tongue. 
An Ouen that is stopt, or riuer stayd, 
Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage: 
So of concealed sorow may be sayd, 
Free vent of wordes loues fier doth asswage, 
      But when the hearts atturney once is mute, 
      The client breakes, as desperat in his sute. 
He sees her comming, and begins to glow, 
Euen as a dying coale reuiues with winde, 
And with his bonnet hides his angrie brow, 
Lookes on the dull earth with disturbed minde: 
      Taking no notice that she is so nye, 
      For all askance he holds her in his eye. 
O what a sight it was wistly to view, 
How she came stealing to the wayward boy, 
To note the fighting conflict of her hew, 
How white and red, ech other did destroy: 
      But now her cheeke was pale, and by and by 
      It flasht forth fire, as lightning from the skie. 
Now was she iust before him as he sat, 
And like a lowly louer downe she kneeles, 
With one faire hand she heaueth vp his hat, 
Her other tender hand his faire cheeke feeles: 
      His tender cheeke, receiues her soft hands print, 
      As apt, as new falne snow takes any dint. 
Oh what a warre of looks was then betweene them, 
Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing, 
His eyes saw her eyes, as they had not seene them, 
Her eyes wooed still, his eyes disdaind the wooing: 
      And all this dumbe play had his acts made plain, 
      With tears which Chorus-like her eyes did rain. 
Full gently now she takes him by the hand, 
A lillie prisond in a gaile of snow, 
Or Iuorie in an alablaster band, 
So white a friend, ingirts so white a fo: 
      This beautious combat wilfull, and vnwilling, 
      Showed like two siluer doues that sit a billing. 
Once more the engin of her thoughts began, 
O fairest mouer on this mortall round, 
Would thou wert as I am, and I a man, 
My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound, 
      For one sweet looke thy helpe I would assure thee, 
      Thogh nothing but my bodies bane wold cure thee 
Giue me my hand (saith he,) why dost thou feele it? 
Giue me my heart (saith she,) and thou shalt haue it. 
O giue it me lest thy hard heart do steele it, 
And being steeld, soft sighes can neuer graue it. 
      Then loues deepe grones, I neuer shall regard, 
      Because Adonis heart hath made mine hard. 
For shame he cries, let go, and let me go, 
My dayes delight is past, my Horse is gone, 
And tis your fault I am bereft him so, 
I praie you hence, and leaue me here alone, 
      For all my mind, my thought, my busie care, 
      Is how to get my palfrey from the mare. 
Thus she replies, thy palfrey as he should, 
Welcomes the warme approch of sweet desire, 
Affection is a coale that must be coold, 
Else sufferd it will set the heart on fire, 
      The sea hath bounds, but deepe desire hath none, 
      Therefore no maruell though thy horse be gone. 
How like a iade he stood tied to the tree, 
Seruilly maisterd with a leatherne raine, 
But when he saw his loue, his youths faire fee, 
He held such pettie bondage in disdaine: 
      Throwing the base thong from his bending crest, 
      Enfranchising his mouth, his backe, his brest. 
Who seekes his true-loue in her naked bed, 
Teaching the sheets a whiter hew then white, 
But when his glutton eye so full hath fed, 
His other agents ayme at like delight? 
      Who is so faint that dares not be so bold, 
      To touch the fier the weather being cold? 
Let me excuse thy courser gentle boy, 
And learne of him I heartily beseech thee, 
To take aduantage on presented ioy, 
Though I were dube, yet his proceedings teach thee 
      O learne to loue, the lesson is but plaine, 
      And once made perfect, neuer lost againe. 
I know not loue (quoth he) nor will not know it, 
Vnlesse it be a Boare, and then I chase it, 
Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it, 
My loue to loue, is loue, but to disgrace it, 
      For I haue heard, it is a life in death, 
      That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath. 
Who weares a garment shapelesse and vnfinisht? 
Who plucks the bud before one leafe put forth? 
If springing things be anie iot diminisht, 
They wither in their prime, proue nothing worth, 
      The colt that&#39;s backt and burthend being yong, 
      Loseth his pride, and neuer waxeth strong. 
You hurt my hand with wringing, let vs part, 
And leaue this idle theame, this bootlesse chat, 
Remoue your siege from my vnyeelding heart, 
To loues alarmes it will not ope the gate, 
      Dismisse your vows, your fained tears, your flattry, 
      For where a heart is hard they make no battry. 
What canst thou talke (quoth she) hast thou a tong? 
O would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing, 
Thy marmaides voice hath done me double wrong, 
I had my lode before, now prest with bearing, 
      Mellodious discord, heauenly tune harsh sounding, 
      Eares deep sweet musik, &amp; harts deep sore wouding. 
Had I no eyes but eares, my eares would loue, 
That inward beauty and inuisible, 
Or were I deafe, thy outward parts would moue 
Ech part in me, that were but sensible, 
      Though neither eyes, nor eares, to heare nor see, 
      Yet should I be in loue, by touching thee. 
Say that the sence of feeling were bereft me, 
And that I could not see, nor heare, nor touch, 
And nothing but the verie smell were left me, 
Yet would my loue to thee be still as much, 
      For from the stillitorie of thy face excelling, 
      Coms breath perfumd, that breedeth loue by smelling. 
But oh what banquet wert thou to the tast, 
Being nourse, and feeder of the other foure, 
Would they not wish the feast might euer last, 
And bid suspition double locke the dore; 
      Least iealousie that sower vnwelcome guest, 
      Should by his stealing in disturbe the feast? 
Once more the rubi-colourd portall opend, 
Which to his speech did honie passage yeeld, 
Like a red morne that euer yet betokend, 
Wracke to the sea-man, tempest to the field: 
      Sorrow to sheapheards, wo vnto the birds, 
      Gusts, and fowle flawes, to heardmen, and to herds. 
This ill presage aduisedly she marketh, 
Euen as the wind is husht before it raineth: 
Or as the wolfe doth grin before he barketh: 
Or as the berrie breakes before it staineth: 
      Or like the deadly bullet of a gun: 
      His meaning strucke her ere his words begun. 
And at his looke she flatly falleth downe, 
For lookes kill loue, and loue by lookes reuiueth, 
A smile recures the wounding of a frowne, 
But blessed bankrout that by loue so thriueth. 
      The sillie boy beleeuing she is dead, 
      Claps her pale cheeke, till clapping makes it red. 
And all amaz&#39;d, brake off his late intent, 
For sharplie he did thinke to reprehend her, 
Which cunning loue did wittily preuent, 
Faire-fall the wit that can so well defend her: 
      For on the grasse she lies as she were slaine, 
      Till his breath breatheth life in her againe. 
He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheekes, 
He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard, 
He chafes her lips, a thousand wayes he seekes 
To mend the hurt, that his vnkindnesse mard, 
      He kisses her, and she by her good will, 
      Will neuer rise, so he will kisse her still. 
The night of sorrow now is turnd to day, 
Her two blew windowes faintly she vpheaueth, 
Like the faire sunne when in his fresh array, 
He cheeres the morne, and all the world relieueth: 
      And as the bright sunne glorifies the skie: 
      So is her face illumind with her eye. 
Whose beames vpon his hairelesse face are fixt, 
As if from thence they borrowed all their shine; 
Were neuer foure such lamps, together mixt, 
Had not his clouded with his browes repine: 
      But hers, which through the cristal tears gaue light, 
      Shone like the Moone in water seene by night. 
O where am I (quoth she,) in earth or heauen, 
Or in the Ocean drencht, or in the fire: 
What houre is this, or morne, or wearie euen, 
Do I delight to die or life desire? 
      But now I liu&#39;d, and life was deaths annoy, 
      But now I dy&#39;de, and death was liuelie ioy. 
O thou didst kill me, kill me once againe, 
Thy eyes shrowd tutor, that hard heart of thine, 
Hath taught them scornfull tricks, &amp; such disdaine, 
That they haue murdred this poore heart of mine, 
      And these mine eyes true leaders to their queene, 
      But for thy piteous lips no more had seene. 
Long may they kisse ech other for this cure, 
Oh neuer let their crimson liueries weare, 
And as they last, their verdour still endure, 
To driue infection from the dangerous yeare: 
      That the star-gazers hauing writ on death, 
      May say, the plague is banisht by thy breath. 
Pure lips, sweet seales in my soft lips imprinted, 
What bargaines may I make still to be sealing? 
To sell my selfe I can be well contented, 
So thou wilt buy, and pay, and vse good dealing, 
      Which purchase if thou make, for feare of slips, 
      Set thy seale manuell, on my wax-red lips. 
A thousand kisses buyes my heart from me, 
And paie them at thy leysure, one by one, 
What is ten hundred touches vnto thee, 
Are they not quickly told, and quickly gone? 
      Say for none-paimet, that the debt should double, 
      Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble? 
Faire Queene (quoth he) if any loue you owe me, 
Measure my strangenesse with my vnripe yeares, 
Before I know my selfe, seeke not to know me, 
No fisher but the vngrowne frie forbeares, 
      The mellow plum doth fall, the greene sticks fast, 
      Or being early pluckt, is sower to tast. 
Looke the worlds comforter with wearie gate, 
His dayes hot taske hath ended in the west, 
The owle (nights herald) shreeks, tis verie late, 
The sheepe are gone to fold, birds to their nest, 
      And cole-black clouds, that shadow heauens light, 
      Do summon vs to part, and bid good night. 
Now let me say good night, and so say you, 
If you will say so, you shall haue a kis; 
Goodnight (quoth she) and ere he sayes adue, 
The honie fee of parting tendred is, 
      Her armes do lend his necke a sweet imbrace, 
      Incorporat then they seeme, face growes to face. 
Till breathlesse he disioynd, and backward drew, 
The heauenly moisture that sweet corall mouth, 
Whose precious tast, her thirstie lips well knew, 
Whereon they surfet, yet complaine on drouth, 
      He with her plentie prest, she faint with dearth, 
      Their lips together glewed, fall to the earth. 
Now quicke desire hath caught the yeelding pray, 
And gluttonlike she feeds, yet neuer filleth, 
Her lips are conquerers, his lips obay, 
Paying what ransome the insulter willeth: 
      Whose vultur thought doth pitch the price so hie, 
      That she will draw his lips rich treasure drie. 
And hauing felt the sweetnesse of the spoile, 
With blindfold fury she begins to forrage, 
Her face doth reeke, &amp; smoke, her blood doth boile, 
And carelesse lust stirs vp a desperate courage, 
      Planting obliuion, beating reason backe, 
      Forgetting shames pure blush, &amp; honors wracke. 
Hot, faint, and wearie, with her hard imbracing, 
Like a wild bird being tam&#39;d with too much hadling, 
Or as the fleet-foot Roe that&#39;s tyr&#39;d with chasing, 
Or like the froward infant stild with dandling: 
      He now obayes, and now no more resisteth, 
      While she takes all she can, not all she listeth. 
What waxe so frozen but dissolues with tempring, 
And yeelds at last to euerie light impression? 
Things out of hope, are compast oft with ventring, 
Chiefly in loue, whose leaue exceeds commission: 
      Affection faints not like a pale fac&#39;d coward, 
      But the woes best, when most his choise is froward. 
When he did frowne, ô had she then gaue ouer, 
Such nectar from his lips she had not suckt, 
Foule wordes, and frownes, must not repell a louer, 
What though the rose haue prickles, yet tis pluckt? 
      Were beautie vnder twentie locks kept fast, 
      Yet loue breaks through, &amp; picks them all at last. 
For pitie now she can no more detaine him, 
The poore foole praies her that he may depart, 
She is resolu&#39;d no longer to restraine him, 
Bids him farewell, and looke well to her hart, 
      The which by Cupids bow she doth protest, 
      He carries thence incaged in his brest. 
Sweet boy she saies, this night Ile wast in sorrow, 
For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch, 
Tell me loues maister, shall we meete to morrow, 
Say, shall we, shall we, wilt thou make the match? 
      He tell&#39;s her no, to morrow he intends, 
      To hunt the boare with certaine of his frends. 
The boare (quoth she) whereat a suddain pale, 
Like lawne being spred vpon the blushing rose, 
Vsurpes her cheeke, she trembles at his tale, 
And on his neck her yoaking armes she throwes. 
      She sincketh downe, still hanging by his necke, 
      He on her bellie fall&#39;s, she on her backe. 
Now is she in the verie lists of loue, 
Her champion mounted for the hot incounter, 
All is imaginarie she doth proue, 
He will not mannage her, although he mount her, 
      That worse then Tantalus is her annoy, 
      To clip Elizium, and to lacke her ioy. 
Euen so poore birds deceiu&#39;d with painted grapes, 
Do surfet by the eye, and pine the maw: 
Euen so she languisheth in her mishaps, 
As those poore birds that helplesse berries saw, 
      The warme effects which she in him finds missing, 
      She seekes to kindle with continuall kissing. 
But all in vaine, good Queene, it will not bee, 
She hath assai&#39;d as much as may be prou&#39;d, 
Her pleading hath deseru&#39;d a greater fee, 
She&#39;s loue; she loues, and yet she is not lou&#39;d, 
      Fie, fie, he saies, you crush me, let me go, 
      You haue no reason to withhold me so. 
Thou hadst bin gone (quoth she) sweet boy ere this, 
But that thou toldst me, thou woldst hunt the boare, 
Oh be aduisd, thou know&#39;st not what it is, 
With iauelings point a churlish swine to goare, 
      Whose tushes neuer sheathd, he whetteth still, 
      Like to a mortall butcher bent to kill. 
On his bow backe, he hath a battell set, 
Of brisly pikes that euer threat his foes, 
His eyes like glow-wormes shine, when he doth fret 
His snout digs sepulchers where ere he goes, 
      Being mou&#39;d he strikes, what ere is in his way, 
      And whom he strikes, his crooked tushes slay. 
His brawnie sides with hairie bristles armed, 
Are better proofe then thy speares point can enter, 
His short thick necke cannot be easily harmed, 
Being irefull, on the Lion he will venter, 
      The thornie brambles, and imbracing bushes, 
      As fearefull of him part, through whom he rushes. 
Alas, he naught esteem&#39;s that face of thine, 
To which loues eyes paies tributarie gazes, 
Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips, and christall eine, 
Whose full perfection all the world amazes, 
      But hauing thee at vantage (wondrous dread!) 
      Wold roote these beauties, as he root&#39;s the mead. 
Oh let him keepe his loathsome cabin still, 
Beautie hath naught to do with such foule fiends, 
Come not within his danger by thy will, 
They that thriue well, take counsell of their friends, 
      Whe thou didst name the boare, not to disseble, 
      I feard thy fortune, and my ioynts did tremble. 
Didst thou not marke my face, was it not white? 
Sawest thou not signes of feare lurke in mine eye? 
Grew I not faint, and fell I not downe right? 
Within my bosome whereon thou doest lye, 
      My boding heart, pants, beats, and takes no rest, 
      But like an earthquake, shakes thee on my brest. 
For where loue raignes, disturbing iealousie, 
Doth call himselfe affections centinell, 
Giues false alarmes, suggesteth mutinie, 
And in a peacefull houre doth crie, kill, kill, 
      Distempring gentle loue in his desire, 
      As aire, and water do abate the fire. 
This sower informer, this bate-breeding spie, 
This canker that eates vp loues tender spring, 
This carrie-tale, dissentious iealousie, 
That somtime true newes, somtime false doth bring, 
      Knocks at my heart, and whispers in mine eare, 
      That if I loue thee, I thy death should feare. 
And more then so, presenteth to mine eye, 
The picture of an angrie chafing boare, 
Vnder whose sharpe fangs, on his backe doth lie, 
An image like thy selfe, all staind with goare, 
      Whose blood vpon the fresh flowers being shed, 
      Doth make the droope with grief, &amp; hang the hed. 
What should I do, seeing thee so indeed? 
That tremble at th&#39;imagination? 
The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed, 
And feare doth teach it diuination; 
      I prophecie thy death, my liuing sorrow, 
      If thou incounter with the boare to morrow. 
But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul&#39;d by me, 
Vncouple at the timerous flying hare, 
Or at the Foxe which liues by subtiltie, 
Or at the Roe which no incounter dare: 
      Pursue these fearfull creatures o&#39;re the downes, 
      And on thy wel breathd horse keep with thy houds 
And when thou hast on foote the purblind hare, 
Marke the poore wretch to ouer-shut his troubles, 
How he outruns the wind, and with what care, 
He crankes and crosses with a thousand doubles, 
      The many musits through the which he goes, 
      Are like a laberinth to amaze his foes. 
Sometime he runnes among a flocke of sheepe, 
To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell, 
And sometime where earth-deluing Conies keepe, 
To stop the loud pursuers in their yell: 
      And sometime sorteth with a heard of deare, 
      Danger deuiseth shifts, wit waites on feare. 
For there his smell with others being mingled, 
The hot sent-snuffing hounds are driuen to doubt, 
Ceasing their clamorous crie, till they haue singled 
With much ado the cold fault cleanlie out, 
      Then do they spend their mouth&#39;s, eccho replies, 
      As if an other chase were in the skies. 
By this poore wat farre off vpon a hill, 
Stands on his hinder-legs with listning eare, 
To hearken if his foes pursue him still, 
Anon their loud alarums he doth heare, 
      And now his griefe may be compared well, 
      To one sore sicke, that heares the passing bell. 
Then shalt thou see the deaw-bedabbled wretch, 
Turne, and returne, indenting with the way, 
Ech enuious brier, his wearie legs do scratch, 
Ech shadow makes him stop, ech murmour stay, 
      For miserie is troden on by manie, 
      And being low, neuer releeu&#39;d by anie. 
Lye quietly, and heare a litle more, 
Nay do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise, 
To make thee hate the hunting of the bore, 
Vnlike my selfe thou hear&#39;st me moralize, 
      Applying this to that, and so to so, 
      For loue can comment vpon euerie wo, 
Where did I leaue? no matter where (quoth he) 
Leaue me, and then the storie aptly ends, 
The night is spent; why what of that (quoth she?) 
I am (quoth he) expected of my frends, 
      And now tis darke, and going I shall fall, 
      In night (quoth she) desire sees best of all. 
But if thou fall, oh then imagine this, 
The earth in loue with thee, thy footing trips, 
And all is but to rob thee of a kis, 
Rich prayes make true-men theeues: so do thy lips 
      Make modest Dyan, cloudie and forlorne, 
      Lest she should steale a kisse and die forsworne. 
Now of this darke night I perceiue the reason, 
Cinthia for shame, obscures her siluer shine, 
Till forging nature be condemn&#39;d of treason, 
For stealing moulds from heauen, that were diuine, 
      Wherin she fram&#39;d thee, in hie heauens despight, 
      To shame the sunne by day, and her by night. 
And therefore hath she brib&#39;d the destinies, 
To crosse the curious workmanship of nature, 
To mingle beautie with infirmities, 
And pure perfection with impure defeature, 
      Making it subiect to the tyrannie, 
      Of mad mischances, and much miserie. 
As burning feauers, agues pale, and faint, 
Life-poysoning pestilence, and frendzies wood, 
The marrow-eating sicknesse whose attaint, 
Disorder breeds by heating of the blood, 
      Surfets, impostumes, griefe, and damnd dispaire, 
      Sweare natures death, for framing thee so faire. 
And not the least of all these maladies, 
But in one minutes fight brings beautie vnder, 
Both fauour, sauour, hew, and qualities, 
Whereat th&#39;impartiall gazer late did wonder, 
      Are on the sudden wasted, thawed, and done, 
      As mountain snow melts with the midday sunne. 
Therefore despight of fruitlesse chastitie, 
Loue-lacking vestals, and selfe-louing Nuns, 
That on the earth would breede a scarcitie, 
And barraine dearth of daughters, and of sons; 
      Be prodigall, the lampe that burnes by night, 
      Dries vp his oile, to lend the world his light. 
What is thy bodie but a swallowing graue, 
Seeming to burie that posteritie, 
Which by the rights of time thou needs must haue, 
If thou destroie them not in darke obscuritie? 
      If so the world will hold thee in disdaine, 
      Sith in thy pride, so faire a hope is slaine. 
So in thy selfe, thy selfe art made away, 
A mischiefe worse then ciuill home-bred strife, 
Or theirs whose desperat hands themselues do slay, 
Or butcher sire, that reaues his sonne of life: 
      Foule cankring rust, the hidden treasure frets, 
      But gold that&#39;s put to vse more gold begets. 
Nay then (quoth Adon) you will fall againe, 
Into your idle ouer-handled theame, 
The kisse I gaue you is bestow&#39;d in vaine, 
And all in vaine you striue against the streame, 
      For by this black-fac&#39;t night, desires foule nourse, 
      Your treatise makes me like you, worse &amp; worse. 
If loue haue lent you twentie thousand tongues, 
And euerie tongue more mouing then your owne, 
Bewitching like the wanton Marmaids songs, 
Yet from mine eare the tempting tune is blowne, 
      For know my heart stands armed in mine eare, 
      And will not let a false sound enter there. 
Lest the deceiuing harmonie should ronne, 
Into the quiet closure of my brest, 
And then my litle heart were quite vndone, 
In his bed-chamber to be bard of rest, 
      No Ladie no, my heart longs not to grone, 
      But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone. 
What haue you vrg&#39;d, that I can not reproue? 
The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger, 
I hate not loue, but your deuise in loue, 
That lends imbracements vnto euerie stranger, 
      You do it for increase, ô strange excuse! 
      When reason is the bawd to lusts abuse. 
Call it not loue, for loue to heauen is fled, 
Since sweating lust on earth vsurpt his name, 
Vnder whose simple semblance he hath fed, 
Vpon fresh beautie, blotting it with blame; 
      Which the hot tyrant staines, &amp; soone bereaues: 
      As Caterpillers do the tender leaues. 
Loue comforteth like sun-shine after raine, 
But lusts effect is tempest after sunne, 
Loues gentle spring doth alwayes fresh remaine, 
Lusts winter comes, ere sommer halfe be donne: 
      Loue surfets not, lust like a glutton dies: 
      Loue is all truth, lust full of forged lies. 
More I could tell, but more I dare not say, 
The text is old, the Orator too greene, 
Therefore in sadnesse, now I will away, 
My face is full of shame, my heart of teene, 
      Mine eares that to your wanton talke attended, 
      Do burne themselues, for hauing so offended. 
With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace, 
Of those faire armes which bound him to her brest, 
And homeward through the dark lawnd runs apace, 
Leaues loue vpon her backe, deeply distrest, 
      Looke how a bright star shooteth from the skye; 
      So glides he in the night from Venus eye. 
Which after him she dartes, as one on shore 
Gazing vpon a late embarked friend, 
Till the wilde waues will haue him seene no more, 
Whose ridges with the meeting cloudes contend: 
      So did the mercilesse, and pitchie night, 
      Fold in the obiect that did feed her sight. 
Whereat amas&#39;d as one that vnaware, 
Hath dropt a precious iewell in the flood, 
Or stonisht, as night wandrers often are, 
Their light blowne out in some mistrustfull wood; 
      Euen so confounded in the darke she lay, 
      Hauing lost the faire discouerie of her way. 
And now she beates her heart, whereat it grones, 
That all the neighbour caues as seeming troubled, 
Make verball repetition of her mones, 
Passion on passion, deeply is redoubled, 
      Ay me, she cries, and twentie times, wo, wo, 
      And twentie ecchoes, twentie times crie so. 
She marking them, begins a wailing note, 
And sings extemporally a wofull dittie, 
How loue makes yong men thrall, &amp; old men dote, 
How loue is wise in follie, foolish wittie: 
      Her heauie antheme still concludes in wo, 
      And still the quier of ecchoes answer so. 
Her song was tedious, and out-wore the night, 
For louers houres are long, though seeming short, 
If pleasd themselues, others they thinke delight 
In such like circumstance, with such like sport: 
      Their copious stories oftentimes begunne, 
      End without audience, and are neuer donne. 
For who hath she to spend the night withall, 
But idle sounds resembling parasits? 
Like shrill-tongu&#39;d Tapsters answering euerie call, 
Soothing the humor of fantastique wits, 
      She sayes tis so, they answer all tis so, 
      And would say after her, if she said no. 
Lo here the gentle larke wearie of rest, 
From his moyst cabinet mounts vp on hie, 
And wakes the morning, from whose siluer brest, 
The sunne ariseth in his maiestie, 
      Who doth the world so gloriously behold, 
      That Ceader tops and hils, seeme burnisht gold. 
Venus salutes him with this faire good morrow, 
Oh thou cleare god, and patron of all light, 
From whom ech lamp, &amp; shining star doth borrow, 
The beautious influence that makes him bright, 
      There liues a sonne that suckt an earthly mother, 
      May lend thee light, as thou doest lend to other. 
This said, she hasteth to a mirtle groue, 
Musing the morning is so much ore-worne, 
And yet she heares no tidings of her loue; 
She harkens for his hounds, and for his horne, 
      Anon she heares them chaunt it lustily, 
      And all in hast she coasteth to the cry. 
And as she runnes, the bushes in the way, 
Some catch her by the necke, some kisse her face, 
Some twin&#39;d about her thigh to make her stay, 
She wildly breaketh from their strict imbrace, 
      Like a milch Doe, whose swelling dugs do ake, 
      Hasting to feed her fawne, hid in some brake. 
By this she heares the hounds are at a bay, 
Wherat she starts like one that spies an adder, 
Wreath&#39;d vp in fatall folds iust in his way, 
The feare whereof doth make him shake, &amp; shudder, 
      Euen so the timerous yelping of the hounds, 
      Appals her senses, and her spirit confounds. 
For now she knowes it is no gentle chase, 
But the blunt boare, rough beare, or lyon proud, 
Because the crie remaineth in one place, 
Where fearefully the dogs exclaime aloud, 
      Finding their enemie to be so curst, 
      They all straine curt&#39;sie who shall cope him first. 
This dismall crie rings sadly in her eare, 
Through which it enters to surprise her hart, 
Who ouercome by doubt, and bloudlesse feare, 
With cold-pale weakenesse, nums ech feeling part, 
      Like soldiers when their captain once doth yeeld, 
      They basely flie, and dare not stay the field. 
Thus stands she in a trembling extasie, 
Till cheering vp her senses all dismayd, 
She tels them tis a causlesse fantasie, 
And childish error that they are affrayd, 
      Bids the leaue quaking, bids them feare no more, 
      And with that word, she spide the hunted boare. 
Whose frothie mouth be painted all with red, 
Like milke, &amp; bloud, being mingled both togither, 
A second feare through all her sinewes spred, 
Which madly hurries her, she knowes not whither, 
      This way she runs, and now she will no further, 
      But backe retires, to rate the boare for murther. 
A thousand spleenes beare her a thousand wayes, 
She treads the path, that she vntreads againe; 
Her more then hast, is mated with delayes, 
Like the proceedings of a drunken braine, 
      Full of respects, yet naught at all respecting, 
      In hand with all things, naught at all effecting. 
Here kenneld in a brake, she finds a hound, 
And askes the wearie caitiffe for his maister, 
And there another licking of his wound, 
Gainst venimd sores, the onely soueraigne plaister. 
      And here she meets another, sadly skowling, 
      To whom she speaks, &amp; he replies with howling. 
When he hath ceast his ill resounding noise, 
Another flap mouthd mourner, blacke, and grim, 
Against the welkin, volies out his voyce, 
Another, and another, answer him, 
      Clapping their proud tailes to the ground below, 
      Shaking their scratcht-eares, bleeding as they go. 
Looke how, the worlds poore people are amazed, 
At apparitions, signes, and prodigies, 
Whereon with feareful eyes, they long haue gazed, 
Infusing them with dreadfull prophecies; 
      So she at these sad signes, drawes vp her breath. 
      And sighing it againe, exclaimes on death. 
Hard fauourd tyrant, ougly, meagre, leane, 
Hatefull diuorce of loue, (thus chides she death) 
Grim-grinning ghost, earths-worme what dost thou meane? 
To stifle beautie, and to steale his breath? 
      Who when he liu&#39;d, his breath and beautie set 
      Glosse on the rose, smell to the violet. 
If he be dead, ô no, it cannot be, 
Seeing his beautie, thou shouldst strike at it, 
Oh yes, it may, thou hast no eyes to see, 
But hatefully at randon doest thou hit, 
      Thy marke is feeble age, but thy false dart, 
      Mistakes that aime, and cleaues an infants hart. 
Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke, 
And hearing him, thy power had lost his power, 
The destinies will curse thee for this stroke, 
They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluckst a flower, 
      Loues golden arrow at him should haue fled, 
      And not deaths ebon dart to strike him dead. 
Doest thou drink tears, that thou prouok&#39;st such weeping, 
What may a heauie grone aduantage thee? 
Why hast thou cast into eternall sleeping, 
Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see? 
      Now nature cares not for thy mortall vigour, 
      Since her best worke is ruin&#39;d with thy rigour. 
Here ouercome as one full of dispaire, 
She vaild her eye-lids, who like sluces stopt, 
The christall tide, that from her two cheekes faire, 
In the sweet channell of her bosome dropt 
      But through the flud-gates breaks the siluer rain, 
      And with his strong course opens them againe. 
O how her eyes, and teares, did lend, and borrow, 
Her eye seene in the teares, teares in her eye, 
Both christals, where they viewd ech others sorrow: 
Sorrow, that friendly sighs sought still to drye, 
      But like a stormy day, now wind, now raine, 
      Sighs drie her cheeks, tears make the wet againe. 
Variable passions throng her constant wo, 
As striuing who should best become her griefe, 
All entertaind, ech passion labours so, 
That euery present sorrow seemeth chiefe, 
      But none is best, then ioyne they all together, 
      Like many clouds, consulting for foule weather. 
By this farre off, she heares some huntsman hallow, 
A nourses song nere pleasd her babe so well, 
The dyre imagination she did follow, 
This sound of hope doth labour to expell, 
      For now reuiuing ioy bids her reioyce, 
      And flatters her, it is Adonis voice. 
Whereat her teares began to turne their tide, 
Being prisond in her eye: like pearles in glasse, 
Yet sometimes fals an orient drop beside, 
Which her cheeke melts, as scorning it should passe 
      To wash the foule face of the sluttish ground, 
      Who is but dronken when she seemeth drownd. 
O hard beleeuing loue how strange it seemes! 
Not to beleeue, and yet too credulous: 
Thy weale, and wo, are both of them extreames, 
Despaire, and hope, makes thee ridiculous. 
      The one doth flatter thee in thoughts vnlikely, 
      In likely thoughts the other kils thee quickly. 
Now she veweaues the web that she hath wrought, 
Adonis liues, and death is not to blame: 
It was not she that cald him all to nought; 
Now she ads honors to his hatefull name. 
      She clepes him king of graues, &amp; graue for kings, 
      Imperious supreme of all mortall things. 
No, no, quoth she, sweet death, I did but iest, 
Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of feare 
When as I met the boare, that bloodie beast, 
Which knowes no pitie but is still seueare, 
      Then gentle shadow (truth I must confesse) 
      I rayld on thee, fearing my loues decesse. 
Tis not my fault, the Bore prouokt my tong, 
Be wreakt on him (inuisible commander) 
Tis he foule creature, that hath done thee wrong, 
I did but act, he&#39;s author of thy slaunder. 
      Greefe hath two tongues, and neuer woman yet 
      Could rule them both, without ten womens wit. 
Thus hoping that Adonis is aliue, 
Her rash suspect she doth extenuate, 
And that his beautie may the better thriue, 
With death she humbly doth insinuate. 
      Tels him of trophies, statues, tombes, and stories, 
      His victories, his triumphs, and his glories. 
O Ioue quoth she, how much a foole was I, 
To be of such a weake and sillie mind, 
To waile his death who liues, and must not die, 
Till mutuall ouerthrow of mortall kind? 
      For he being dead, with him is beautie slaine, 
      And beautie dead, blacke Chaos comes againe. 
Fy, fy, fond loue, thou art as full of feare, 
As one with treasure laden, hem&#39;d with the eues, 
Trifles vnwitnessed with eye, or eare, 
Thy coward heart with false bethinking greeues. 
      Euen at this word she heares a merry horne, 
      Whereat she leaps, that was but late forlorne. 
As Faulcons to the lure, away she flies, 
The grasse stoops not, she treads on it so light, 
And in her hast, vnfortunately spies 
The foule Boares conquest, on her faire delight, 
      Which seene, her eyes are murdred with the view, 
      Like stars asham&#39;d of day, themselues withdrew. 
Or as the snaile, whose tender hornes being hit, 
Shrinks backward in his shellie caue with paine, 
And, there all smoothred vp, in shade doth sit, 
Long after fearing to creepe forth againe: 
      So at his bloudie view her eyes are fled, 
      Into the deepe-darke cabbins of her head. 
Where they resigne their office, and their light, 
To the disposing of her troubled braine, 
Who bids them still consort with vgly night, 
And neuer wound the heart with lookes againe, 
      Who like a king perplexed in his throne, 
      By their suggestion, giues a deadly grone. 
Whereat ech tributarie subiect quakes, 
As when the wind imprisond in the ground, 
Struggling for passage, earths foundation shakes, 
Which with cold terror, doth mens minds confoud: 
      This mutinie ech part doth so surprise, 
      That fro their dark-beds once more leap her eies, 
And being opend, threw vnwilling light 
Vpon the wide wound, that the Boare had trencht 
In his soft flanke, whose wonted lillie white 
With purple tears that his woud wept, had drencht, 
      No floure was nigh, no grasse, hearb, leaf, or weed, 
      But stole his blood, and seemd with him to bleed. 
This solemne sympathie, poore Venus noteth, 
Ouer one shoulder doth she hang her head, 
Dumblie she passions, frantikely she doteth, 
She thinkes he could not die, he is not dead, 
      Her voice is stopt, her ioynts forget to bow, 
      Her eyes are mad, that they haue wept till now. 
Vpon his hurt she lookes so stedfastly, 
That her sight dazling, makes the wound seem three, 
And then she reprehends her mangling eye, 
That makes more gashes, where no breach shuld be: 
      His face seemes twain, ech seuerall lim is doubled, 
      For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled. 
My tongue cannot expresse my griefe for one, 
And yet (quoth she) behold two Adons dead, 
My sighes are blowne away, my salt teares gone, 
Mine eyes are turn&#39;d to fire, my heart to lead, 
      Heauie hearts lead melt at mine eyes red fire, 
      So shall I die by drops of hot desire. 
Alas poore world what treasure hast thou lost, 
What face remains aliue that&#39;s worth the viewing? 
Whose tong is musicke now? what canst thou boast 
Of things long since, or anie thing ensuing? 
      The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh, &amp; trim, 
      But true sweet beautie liu&#39;d, and di&#39;de with him. 
Bonnet, nor vaile hencefoorth no creature weare, 
Nor sunne, nor winde will euer striue to kisse you, 
Hauing no faire to loose, you need not feare, 
The sun doth scorne you, &amp; the wind doth hisse you. 
      But when Adonis liu&#39;d, sunne, and sharpe aire, 
      Lurkt like two theeues, to rob him of his faire. 
And therefore would he put his bonnet on, 
Vnder whose brim the gaudie sunne would peepe, 
The wind would blow it off, and being gon, 
Play with his locks, then would Adonis weepe. 
      And straight in pitie of his tender yeares, 
      They both would striue who first should drie his teares. 
To see his face the Lion walkt along, 
Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him: 
To recreate himselfe when he hath song, 
The Tygre would be tame, and gently heare him. 
      If he had spoke, the woffe would leaue his praie, 
      And neuer fright the sillie lambe that daie. 
When he beheld his shadow in the brooke, 
The fishes spread on it their golden gils, 
When he was by the birds such pleasure tooke, 
That some would sing, some other in their bils 
      Would bring him mulberies &amp; ripe-red cherries, 
      He fed them with his sight, they him with berries. 
But this foule, grim, and vrchin-snowted Boare, 
Whose downeward eye still looketh for a graue: 
Ne&#39;re saw the beautious liuerie that he wore, 
Witnesse the intertainment that he gaue. 
      If he did see his face, why then I know, 
      He thought to kisse him, and hath kild him so. 
Tis true, tis true, thus was Adonis slaine, 
He ran vpon the Boare with his sharpe speare, 
Who would not whet his teeth at him againe, 
But by a kisse thought to perswade him there. 
      And nousling in his flanke the louing swine, 
      Sheath&#39;d vnaware his tuske in his soft groine. 
Had I bene tooth&#39;d like him I must confesse, 
With kissing him I should haue kild him first, 
But he is dead, and neuer did he blesse 
My youth with his, the more am I accurst. 
      With this she falleth in the place she stood, 
      And staines her face with his congealed bloud. 
She lookes vpon his lips, and they are pale, 
She takes him by the hand, and that is cold: 
She whispers in his eares a heauy tale, 
As if they heard the wofull words she told, 
      She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes, 
      Where lo, two lamps burnt out in darknesse lies. 
Two glasses where her selfe, her selfe beheld 
A thousand times, and now no more reflect, 
Their vertue lost, wherein they late exceld, 
And euerie beautie robd of his effect; 
      Wonder of time (quoth she) this is my spight, 
      That thou being dead, the day shuld yet be light. 
Since thou art dead, loe here I prophecie, 
Sorrow on loue hereafter shall attend: 
It shall be wayted on with iealousie, 
Find sweet beginning, but vnsauorie end. 
      Nere setled equally, but high or lo, 
      That all loues pleasure shall not match his wo. 
It shall be fickle, false, and full of fraud, 
Bud, and be blasted, in a breathing while, 
The bottome poyson, and the top ore-strawd 
With sweets, that shall the truest sight beguile, 
      The strongest bodie shall it make most weake, 
      Strike the wise dumb, &amp; teach the foole to speake 
It shall be sparing, and too full of ryot, 
Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures, 
The staring ruffian shall it keepe in quiet, 
Pluck down the rich, inrich the poore with treasures,

Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
Have from the forests shook three summers’ pride,
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
In process of the seasons have I seen,
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived; 
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:
For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred:

For that deep wound it gives my friend and me:
Is’t not enough to torture me alone,
But slave to slavery my sweet’st friend must be?
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed;
Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken,
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed. 
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom&#39;s ward, 
But then my friend&#39;s heart let my poor heart bail;
Whoe’er keeps me, let my heart be his guard:
Thou canst not then use rigor in my jail.
    And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,

Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries—

    Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Sleep is 20
                    remembering the
insignificant flamenco dancer
in Granada
                    who became
important as you watched
the mountain ridge
                    the dry hills
What an idiotic number!
Sleep is twenty
it certainly isn’t twenty sheep
there weren’t that many in the herd
under the cold crest of Sierra Nevada
It’s more like 20 Madison Ave. buses
while I go droning away at my dream life
Each episode is important
that’s what it is! Sequences —
I’ve got going a twenty-act drama
the theatre of the active
the critics are surely there
even the actors
even the flowers presented onstage
even the wild flowers
picked by the wife of the goatherd
each morning early (while I sleep)
under the snow cone
of Sierra Nevada
                    yellow caps like castanets
                    I reach into my bouquet
                    half-dreaming
                    and count twenty
                    yellow capped heads
flowers clicking twenty times
because they like to repeat themselves
as I do as does the morning
or the drama one hopes
will be acted many times
As even these dreams in similar
people’s heads
                         20

		<poem_text>That is why I am here
not among the ibises. Why
the permanent city parasol
covers even me.
             It was the rains
in the occult season. It was the snows
on the lower slopes. It was water
and cold in my mouth.
            A lack of shoes
on what appeared to be cobbles
which were still antique
           Well wild wild whatever
in wild more silent blue
 
           the vase grips the stems
petals fall    the chrysanthemum darkens
           Sometimes this mustard feeling
clutches me also. My sleep is reckoned 
in straws
            Yet I wake up
and am followed into the street.</poem_text>

		<title>A Way of Being</title>
		<poem_text>There we go in cars, did you guess we wore sandals?   
Carrying the till, memorizing its numbers,   
apt at the essential such as rearranging   
languages. They occur from route to route   
like savages who wear shells. 
“I cannot place him.” Yet I do. 
He must ascend indefinitely as airs 
he must regard his image as plastic, 
adhering to the easeful carpet that needs   
footprints and cares for them 
as is their wont in houses, the ones we pass by. 
Such a day/or such a night   
reeling from cabin to cabin 
looking at the cakewalk or merely dancing. 
These adventures in broad/or slim 
lamplight, 
                                     Yet the cars 
do not cheat, even their colors perform in storm.   
We never feel the scratch, they do. 
When lightning strikes it’s safer to ride 
on rubber going down a mountain, 
safer than trees, or sand, more preventive   
to be hid in a cloud we sing, remembering 
The old manse and robins. One tear, 
a salty one knowing we have escaped 
the charm of being native. Even as your glance   
through the windshield tells me you’ve seen   
another mishap of nature 
                                     you would willingly forget,   
prefer to be like him near the hearth 
where woodsmoke makes a screen of numbers and signs   
where the bedstead it’s not so foreign as this lake. 
                                     The plateau, excursionist, 
is ahead. After that twenty volumes   
of farmland. Then I must guide us 
to the wood garage someone has whitened   
where the light enters through one window   
like a novel. You must peer at it   
without weakening, without feeling   
hero, or heroine, 
                                     Understanding the distances   
between characters, their wakeful 
or sleep searchingness, as far from the twilight ring   
the slow sunset, the quick dark.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Y otras pasan; y viéndome tan triste,toman un poquito de tien la abrupta arruga de mi hondo dolor.                                   Cesar Vellejo
					I won’t let anybody
take a drink
out of this barrel of tears
I’ve collected from you.
Least of all another woman.
I see her coming along.
I know the type. 
I can tell you what she’ll 
be wearing.
I know the type
I won’t like it.
She’ll look at that barrel
she’s had a few in her day.
Not that she’s ever filled one.
She’ll remark casually,
“Sweet water,
good to wash my hair.”
And who doesn’t know
tears are purer
than rain water
and softer on the hair.
Just as she steps toward it
and makes for the cup,
I’ll see phantom you
and what you were
brought up by the sea.
And scraps of paper
from this ditch of my brain
will float on the water
and choke her.</poem_text>

How early it is! It is eight o’clock in the morning.
Well, the pigeons were up earlier
Did you eat all your egg?
Now we shall go for a long walk.
Now? There is too much winter.
I am going to admire the snow on your coat.
Time for hot soup, already?
You have worked for three solid hours.
I have written forty-eight, no forty-nine,
no fifty-one poems.
How many states are there?
I cannot remember what is uniting America.
It is then time for your nap.
What a lovely, pleasant dream I just had.
But I like waking up better.
I do admire reality like snow on my coat.
Would you take cream or lemon in your tea?
No sugar?
And no cigarettes.
Daytime is good, but evening is better.
I do like our evening discussions.
Yesterday we talked about Kant.
Today let’s think about Hegel.
In another week we shall have reached Marx.
Goody. 
Life is a joy if one has industrious hands.
Supper? Stew and well-cooked. Delicious.
Well, perhaps just one more glass of milk.
Nine o’clock! Bath time!
Soap and a clean rough towel.
Bedtime!
The Red Army is marching tonight.
They shall march through my dreams
in their new shiny leather boots,
their freshly laundered shirts.
All those ugly stains of caviar and champagne
and kisses
have been rubbed away.
They are going to the barracks.
They are answering hundreds of pink
and yellow and blue and white telephones.
How happy and contented and well-fed they look
lounging on their fur divans,
chanting, “Russia how kind you are to us.
How kind you are to everybody. 
We want to live forever.”
Before I wake up they will throw away
their pistols, and magically
factories will spring up where once
there was rifle fire, a roulette factory,
where once a body fell from an open window.
Hurry dear dream
I am waiting for you
under the eiderdown.
And tomorrow will be more real, perhaps,
than yesterday.</poem_text>

		<title>Finnish Opera</title>
		<poem_text>Grass grew long in the story. 
Pieces clung to bedclothes. In the night he believed he grew taller.   
Grass covered the dream of a serpent, eyes sunk in his head, tail of silk clover. The dream translated into silver tone. More serpent heads and the   
dream turned into an opera. 
It was the opera that made the dreamer famous. Location of opera could be   
in any country, could be Antarctica, more likely Finland, where they believe   
in silk clover, it is gold in a land of starved desire for summer. 
The opera had a clover leaf copied in porcelain by Aalto, the famous   
designer, who sewed the clover leaf into a white curtain. He designed a   
window for the man when he looks out to sea in his serpent costume. 
This opera that begins with a dream traveled   
to Rome and Zagreb, traveled across continents, once by camel. The travels became more famous than   
the opera. People began to forget whether the grass really had grown long,   
and where the serpent came from. 
The opera was called by another name and included a gold limousine.   
Somewhere in Oceania they added mermaid elves.</poem_text>

		<title>Otranto</title>
		<poem_text>At sunset from the top of the stair watching 
the castle mallets wrenched from their socket 
fell from ambush into flame flew into hiding;   
above the stoneware a latch like muscle hid   
the green; he stood waist high under the rapt 
ceiling and hanged the sparrow; where the kitchen   
had been a mirror of eggs served in a tumbler he 
saw the ring when a lancet pierced and threw it. 
In a basket and lowered it where sails enter 
the harbor over a parchment like dominoes; 
the petrel-like eyelash. 
To the sun and its rites were pulled the dried   
banners; they flew past the ruins the tower 
and window where ivory guided the mist on his back; 
he rubbed his eyes and counted them kneeling 
wrinkled as grass. 
A ghost in their nostrils put a heel at their 
forehead; they saw only the moon as it 
fasted. 
II 
If the ship meant anything if he heard a world 
view in the midst of his rhythm or the spell 
lustrous like hair on his arm; that groaned as 
it struck near the tumble down or 
combing hair; words burnt as they quickened. 
The bitter they share crept into forage and 
muster is in their skin; the grey 
worked like a vise they brushed this 
to turn arrows; they shut off the vast 
cellar and the turret leaped to a pattern; 
the mosaic blended was untouched. 
III 
The frankish hills and hummocks metered 
the greed over sun and cloud; voluptuous 
in the straits turbanned held scarves to the 
water each sail embroidered; 
who washed in their music a lattice. 
A major or borrowed sky this aspect provides 
the lily stalk inside the frame; a gesture the lily 
pointing north as if the wrench from sky decides 
cold rain or change of tide; the lily 
she chooses. 
IV 
Waking in must the high pierced window dew on 
the furnaced bar the poaching hour the cup 
takes smoke from the tower; they drink 
in the smoke the print cradled; cut in dark. 
The siege made cloth a transfer 
learned from invaders who craved it; 
spindle thieves. 
She sang high notes and pebbles went into her 
work where it changed into marks; in that room 
the armor-like wrens: 
rites turned with thread a dower 
begs lapis; eglantine on a spoon; the castle 
breeds tallow. 
V 
A change of tide might delay the run 
they watched as if by simple water; 
read magisterially whatever the book decided; 
night outside covered with filmic screen 
ghosts they store; then bring an experimental 
wheel out of hiding. 
Even the Nile wind; fortune cards 
jugglers a remedy from old clothes; 
to appease the fable—pearls 
rolling in straw. 
The way a cowslip bends 
they remember or Troilus as he stared; 
they agree on brighter covers; looser 
shifts fluent tower to tower. 
More ephemeral than roundness or 
the grown pear tree connected 
with vision a rose briar. 
VI 
There was only a rugged footpath 
above the indifferent straits and a shelf where the 
castle lay perhaps it was sphered like Otranto; 
there the traveller stood naked and talked 
aloud or found a lily and thought a sword; 
or dragged a carcass upon blunt stone like a 
corded animal. In weeds in spiritual 
seclusion a felt hand lifted.</poem_text>

					Words
      after all

and you put them
     in their place
     notes
     sounds
a painter using his stroke
     so the spot
where the article
     an umbrella
     a knife
we could find
     in its most intricate
     hiding
slashed as it was with color
     called “being”
     or even “it”
Expressions
For the moment just
     when the syllables
     out of their webs float
We were just
     beginning to hear
like a crane hoisted into
     the fine thin air
that had a little ache (or soft crackle)
     golden staffed edge of
     quick Mercury
     the scale runner
Envoi
     C’est juste
     your umbrella colorings
dense as telephone
     voice 
     humming down the line
     polyphonic
Red plumaged birds
     not so natural
     complicated wings
                              French!
Sweet difficult passages 
                              on your throats
there just there

		<poem_text>In the past we listened to photographs. They heard our voice speak.   
Alive, active. What had been distance was memory.    Dusk came, 
Pushed us forward,   emptying the laboratory   each night undisturbed by   
Erasure. 
      In the city of X, they lived together. Always morose, her lips 
soothed him. The piano was arranged in the old manner, light entered the   
window, street lamps at the single tree. 
      Emotion evoked by a single light on a subject is not transferable to   
photographs of the improved city. The camera, once 
commented freely amid rivering and lost gutters of treeless parks or avenue.   
The old camera refused to penetrate the unknown. Its heart was soft,   
unreliable. 
      Now distributed is photography of new government building. We are   
forbidden to observe despair silent in old photographs.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>“painting has no air . . .”          —Gertrude Stein
					That there should never be air
in a picture surprises me.
It would seem to be only a picture
of a certain kind, a portrait in paper
or glue, somewhere a stickiness
as opposed to a stick-to-it-ness
of another genre. It might be
quite new to do without
that air, or to find oxygen
on the landscape line
like a boat which is an object
or a shoe which never floats
and is stationary.
                              Still there
are certain illnesses that require
air, lots of it. And there are nervous
people who cannot manufacture
enough air and must seek
for it when they don’t have plants,
in pictures. There is the mysterious
traveling that one does outside
the cube and this takes place
in air.
                              It is why one develops
an attitude toward roses picked
in the morning air, even roses
without sun shining on them.
The roses of Juan Gris from which
we learn the selflessness of roses
existing perpetually without air,
the lid being down, so to speak,
a 1912 fragrance sifting
to the left corner where we read
“La Merveille” and escape.</poem_text>

The sweet knees of oxen have pressed a path for me   
ghosts with ingots have burned their bare hands   
it is the dungaree darkness with China stitched   
where the westerly winds 
and the traveler’s checks 
the evensong of salesmen 
the glistening paraphernalia of twin suitcases   
where no one speaks English.

It is the wind, the rubber wind 
when we brush our teeth in the way station   
a climate to beard. What forks these roads? 
Who clammers o’er the twain? 
What murmurs and rustles in the distance 
in the white branches where the light is whipped   
piercing at the crossing as into the dunes we simmer   
and toss ourselves awhile the motor pants like a forest   
where owls from their bandaged eyes send messages   
to the Indian couple. Peaks have you heard?

We have reached the arithmetics, are partially quenched   
while it growls and hints in the lost trapper’s voice

		<title>The Blue Stairs</title>
		<poem_text>There is no fear
in taking the first step
or the second 
or the third
                                 having a position 
                                 between several Popes
In fact the top
can be reached
without disaster
                                 precocious 
The code 
consists in noticing
the particular shade
of the staircase
                                 occasionally giving way
                                 to the emotions
It has been chosen
discriminately
To graduate 
the dimensions
ease them into sight
                                 republic of space
Radiant deepness
a thumb
passed over it
                                 disarming
                                 as one who executes robbers
Waving the gnats
and the small giants
aside
                                 balancing
How to surprise
a community
by excellence
somehow it occurred
                                 living a public life
The original design
was completed
no one complained
In a few years
it was forgotten
                                 floating
It was framed
like any other work of art
not too ignobly
                                 kicking the ladder away
Now I shall tell you
why it is beautiful
Design: extraordinary
color:    cobalt blue
                                 secret platforms
Heels twist it
into shape
It has a fantastic area
made for a tread
that will ascend
Being humble
i.e. productive
Its purpose
is to take you upward
On an elevator 
of human fingerprints
of the most delicate 
fixity
Being practical
and knowing its denominator
To push
one foot ahead of the other
Being a composite
which sneers at marble
                                 all orthodox movements
It has discovered
in the creak of a footstep
the humility of sound
Spatially selective
using this counterfeit 
of height
To substantiate 
a method of progress
Reading stairs 
as interpolation
in the problem of gradualness
                                 with heavy and pure logic
The master builder
acknowledges this
As do the artists
in their dormer rooms
                                 eternal banishment
Who are usually grateful
to anyone who prevents them
from taking a false step
And having reached the summit
would like to stay there
even if the stairs are withdrawn</poem_text>

On a wall shadowed by lights from the distance   
is the screen. Icons come to it dressed in capes   
and their eyes reflect the journeys their nomadic   
eyes reach from level earth. Narratives are in   
the room where the screen waits suspended like   
the frame of a girder the worker will place upon   
an axis and thus make a frame which he fills with   
a plot or a quarter inch of poetry to encourage   
nature into his building and the tree leaning 
against it, the tree casting language upon the screen.

The telephone is Flaubert’s parrot and it flitters

is holding the dead thing in her hand in a remote   
hotel. A sensitive person with a disability who

tial changes the body knows, the hand feels, the   
truck passes without notice and buildings con- 
tinue their nervous commitments. The earth may   
have been moaning underneath this junk. I am   
caught in the wind’s draft.

At night viewing the screen of distance   
with shadowy icons framed by light   
I understood the rasping interior   
was rearing other icons, 
No longer gentle they flashed ripened clauses,   
or images raised formidable projections of ice,   
the wall was placed in a temporary position   
where words glittered from a dark cover, 
Narcissism lived in a silver hut.   
4 
In the lighter time of year words arrived   
concealed in branches. Flaubert exchanged   
himself for words, night became a night of   
words and a journey a journey of words, and   
so on. 
Words became “a superior joke”, I trembled   
under a revolutionary weight, a coward fleeing   
from a cloud. The ego of words stretched to   
the room’s borders assuming the sonorous   
movement of a poem. 
5 
I entice this novice poem with a mineral, Beryl. 
The dictionary bestows on Beryl a skittish description, 
         like a sequence in which a car 
         moves over ruptured roads and slices   
         into ghost veins of color— 
         a camera follows each turn, 
         examines the exits where rock protects   
         a visionary tool that prods it:— 
 
         “A light greenish blue that is bluer   
         and deeper than average aqua,   
         greener than robin’s eggs blue,   
         bluer and paler than turquoise 
         blue and greener and deeper than beryl 
         blue—a light greenish blue that is bluer 
         and paler than beryl or average turquoise blue— 
         bluer and slightly paler than aqua.” 
The speculative use of mineral prevents an   
attachment to words from overflowing, inserts   
a vein of jazz, emblems of color and overcomes   
the persecuting stretch of racetrack where words   
race their mounts .... 
6 
Beryl became a distraction as one speaks of color   
field or someone as a colorist or of color pre- 
dominant, so the paper on which the poem would   
rest was grainy with color flashing lights   
and the depth, the deepness of the country lane 
on which shadows found repose was a wilderness of   
color, ditches and trees lost their contours. I   
created a planned randomness in which color   
behaved like a star. 
7 
To introduce color to form 
I must darken the window where shrubs   
grazed the delicate words 
the room would behave 
like everything else in nature, 
Experience and emotion performed 
as they did within the zone of distance   
words ending in fluid passages 
created a phenomenal blush 
dispersing illusion .... 
8 
A difficult poem intrudes like hardware   
decorating a quiet building, a tic taking   
over the facade, a shrug exaggerated by a   
column— 
Shelley sailing into the loose wind, 
the storm of neurosis hindering the formal plan,   
a suggested dwelling left on the drawing board   
with clumps of shrubs indicating hysteria or, 
Daylight gleams on the rough street where a   
blameless career sighs, the poet beak dips   
in air, his little wings cause a mild stir,   
as someone comes down the stair 
he pleads with infancy, 
A woman speaks to a dish, old forks, amid her   
preparations she smiles touched by history.   
Chipped, sundry evidences of temporal life   
hiding in a bush. In formal dress domestic   
remarks reel into a corpus known as stanzas. 
9 
The Bride raised the cloud settled on her 
aspen head and stepping away from her bachelors   
she seized like wands the poem I handed her: 
                  “A life glitters under leaves   
                  piled for anonymity ...” 
She would lead us through glass to view the   
enigmatic hill where a castle slung a shadow. 
10 
There was a dream within a dream and inside   
the outer dream lay a rounded piece of white   
marble of perfect circular dimension. 
The dreamer called this marble that resembled   
a grain of Grecian marble, “Eva Knachte,” 
who was blown into the dream by the considerate   
rage of night. 
Her name evoking night became a marble pebble,   
the land on which she rested was the shore   
of the sea that washed over her and changed   
her lineaments into classic marble, a miniature   
being, yet perfect in this dream, her size   
determined by the summer storm with which   
I struggled and seized the marble. 
The marble was a relic, as were the movements   
of nature on the poem. The sea had lent 
a frieze, waves a shoulder when the investitures   
of a symbolic life feuded. In that dimness   
with bristles, straw, armor plate, grotty   
Alexandrines there appeared a mobile fiction .... 
11 
A man who calls himself a Baron yet strays from   
his estate into the cadmium yellow 
of a bewildering sunset rendered by apprehension   
where a broad approach to a narrow tunnel   
is fanned by leaves is faced with a decision—   
at the stylized ominous entrance he wonders   
if reality will maintain him or empathic snow   
subdue his quest .... 
12 
I sifted through these fictive ambiguities   
until there was a plain moment   
something like a black table where 
Dialogue set in motion urged a search   
in memory for that tonal light   
illuminating the screen, 
The Baron faded as distance gleamed   
a clear jar multiplied by frost.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>You can’t say it that way any more.   
Bothered about beauty you have to   
Come out into the open, into a clearing, 
And rest. Certainly whatever funny happens to you 
Is OK. To demand more than this would be strange 
Of you, you who have so many lovers,   
People who look up to you and are willing   
To do things for you, but you think 
It’s not right, that if they really knew you . . . 
So much for self-analysis. Now, 
About what to put in your poem-painting:   
Flowers are always nice, particularly delphinium.   
Names of boys you once knew and their sleds,   
Skyrockets are good—do they still exist? 
There are a lot of other things of the same quality   
As those I’ve mentioned. Now one must 
Find a few important words, and a lot of low-keyed, 
Dull-sounding ones. She approached me 
About buying her desk. Suddenly the street was   
Bananas and the clangor of Japanese instruments.   
Humdrum testaments were scattered around. His head 
Locked into mine. We were a seesaw. Something   
Ought to be written about how this affects   
You when you write poetry: 
The extreme austerity of an almost empty mind 
Colliding with the lush, Rousseau-like foliage of its desire to communicate   
Something between breaths, if only for the sake   
Of others and their desire to understand you and desert you 
For other centers of communication, so that understanding 
May begin, and in doing so be undone.</poem_text>

		<title>Boundary Issues</title>
		<poem_text>Here in life, they would understand.   
How could it be otherwise? We had groped too,   
unwise, till the margin began to give way,   
at which point all was sullen, or lost, or both.   
Now it was time, and there was nothing for it.   
We had a good meal, I and my friend,   
slurping from the milk pail, grabbing at newer vegetables.   
Yet life was a desert. Come home, in good faith.   
You can still decide to. But it wanted warmth.   
Otherwise ruse and subtlety would become impossible   
in the few years or hours left to us. “Yes, but . . .”   
The iconic beggars shuffled off   too. I told you,   
once a breach emerges it will become a chasm   
before anyone’s had a chance to waver. A dispute   
on the far side of town erupts into a war   
in no time at all, and ends as abruptly. The tendency to heal   
sweeps all before it, into the arroyo, the mine shaft,   
into whatever pocket you were contemplating. And the truly lost   
make up for it. It’s always us that has to pay.   
I have a suggestion to make: draw the sting out   
as probingly as you please. Plaster the windows over   
with wood pulp against the noon gloom proposing its enigmas,   
its elixirs. Banish truth-telling. 
That’s the whole point, as I understand it.   
Each new investigation rebuilds the urgency,   
like a sand rampart. And further reflection undermines it,   
causing its eventual collapse. We could see all that   
from a distance, as on a curving abacus, in urgency mode   
from day one, but by then dispatches hardly mattered.   
It was camaraderie, or something like it, that did,   
poring over us like we were papyri, hoping to find one   
correct attitude sketched on the gaslit air, night’s friendly takeover.</poem_text>

		<title>Chinese Whispers</title>
		<poem_text>And in a little while we broke under the strain:   
suppurations ad nauseam, the wanting to be taller,   
though it‘s simply about being mysterious, i.e., not taller,   
like any tree in any forest. 
                                           Mute, the pancake describes you. 
It had tiny roman numerals embedded in its rim. 
It was a pancake clock. They had ’em in those days, 
always getting smaller, which is why they finally became extinct.   
It was a hundred years before anyone noticed. 
                                                                     The governor general 
called it “sinuous.” But we, we had other names for it,   
knew it was going to be around for a long time, 
even though extinct. And sure as shillelaghs fall from trees   
onto frozen doorsteps, it came round again 
when all memory of it had been expunged 
                                                            from the common brain. 
Everybody wants to try one of those new pancake clocks.   
A boyfriend in the next town had one 
but conveniently forgot to bring it over each time we invited him.   
Finally the rumors grew more fabulous than the real thing:   
I hear they are encrusted with tangles of briar rose, 
                                                                                 so dense 
not even a prince seeking the Sleeping Beauty could get inside.   
What’s more, there are more of them than when they were extinct, 
yet the prices keep on rising. They have them in the Hesperides   
and in shantytowns on the edge of the known world,   
blue with cold. All downtowns used to feature them. 
                                                                              Camera obscuras, 
too, were big that year. But why is it that with so many people 
who want to know what a shout is about, nobody can find the original recipe? 
All too soon, no one cares. We go back to doing little things for each other, 
pasting stamps together to form a tiny train track, and other, 
less noticeable things. And the past is forgotten till next time. 
How to describe the years? Some were like blocks of the palest halvah, 
careless of being touched. Some took each others’ trash out,   
put each other’s eyes out. So many got thrown out 
before anyone noticed, that it was like a chiaroscuro 
                                                                                 of collapsing clouds. 
How I longed to visit you again in that old house! But you were deaf,   
or dead. Our letters crossed. A motorboat was ferrying me out past   
the reef, people on shore looked like dolls fingering stuffs. 
                                                                                             More 
keeps coming out, about the dogs I mean. Surely a simple embrace 
from an itinerant fish would have been spurned at certain periods. Not now. 
There is a famine of years in the land, the women are beautiful,   
but prematurely old and worn. It doesn’t get better. Rocks half-buried   
in bands of sand, and spontaneous execrations. 
                                                                      I yell to the ship’s front door, 
wanting to be taller, and somewhere in the middle all this gets lost.   
I was a phantom for a day. My friends carried me around with them. 
It always turns out that much is salvageable. 
                                                                     Chicken coops 
haven’t floated away on the flood. Lacemakers are back in business   
with a vengeance. All the locksmiths had left town during the night.   
It happened to be a beautiful time of season, spring or fall,   
the air was digestible, the fish tied in love-knots 
on their gurneys. Yes, and journeys 
were palpable too: Someone had spoken of saving appearances   
and the walls were just a little too blue in mid-morning.   
Was there ever such a time? I’d like to handle you, 
bruise you with kisses for it, yet something always stops me short:   
the knowledge that this isn‘t history, 
                                                          no matter how many 
times we keep mistaking it for the present, that headlines 
trumpet each day. But behind the unsightly school building, now a pickle 
warehouse, the true nature of things is known, is not overrided:   
Yours is a vote like any other. And there is fraud at the ballot boxes, 
stuffed with lace valentines and fortunes from automatic scales,   
dispensed with a lofty kind of charity, as though this could matter   
to us, these tunes 
                            carried by the wind 
from a barrel organ several leagues away. No, this is not the time   
to reveal your deception to us. Wait till rain and old age   
have softened us up a little more. 
                                                    Then we’ll see how extinct 
the various races have become, how the years stand up   
to their descriptions, no matter how misleading, 
and how long the disbanded armies stay around. I must congratulate you   
on your detective work, for I am a connoisseur 
of close embroidery, though I don’t have a diploma to show for it. 
The trees, the barren trees, have been described more than once.   
Always they are taller, it seems, and the river passes them   
without noticing. We, too, are taller, 
our ceilings higher, our walls more tinctured 
with telling frescoes, our dooryards both airier and vaguer, 
according as time passes and weaves its minute deceptions in and out,   
a secret thread. 
Peace is a full stop. 
And though we had some chance of slipping past the blockade,   
now only time will consent to have anything to do with us,   
for what purposes we do not know.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>That night the wind stirred in the forsythia bushes,
but it was a wrong one, blowing in the wrong direction.
“That’s silly. How can there be a wrong direction?
 ‘It bloweth where it listeth,’ as you know, just as we do
when we make love or do something else there are no rules for.”
I tell you, something went wrong there a while back.
Just don’t ask me what it was. Pretend I’ve dropped the subject.
No, now you’ve got me interested, I want to know
exactly what seems wrong to you, how something could
seem wrong to you. In what way do things get to be wrong?
I’m sitting here dialing my cellphone
with one hand, digging at some obscure pebbles with my shovel
with the other. And then something like braids will stand out,
on horsehair cushions. That armchair is really too lugubrious.
We’ve got to change all the furniture, fumigate the house,
talk our relationship back to its beginnings. Say, you know
that’s probably what’s wrong—the beginnings concept, I mean. 
I aver there are no beginnings, though there were perhaps some
sometime. We’d stopped, to look at the poster the movie theater
had placed freestanding on the sidewalk. The lobby cards
drew us in. It was afternoon, we found ourselves
sitting at the end of a row in the balcony; the theater was unexpectedly
crowded. That was the day we first realized we didn’t fully
know our names, yours or mine, and we left quietly
amid the gray snow falling. Twilight had already set in.</poem_text>

“No rest for the weary.” (And yet—why not?)

		<poem_text>The first of the undecoded messages read: “Popeye sits in thunder,   
Unthought of. From that shoebox of an apartment, 
From livid curtain’s hue, a tangram emerges: a country.” 
Meanwhile the Sea Hag was relaxing on a green couch: “How pleasant   
To spend one’s vacation en la casa de Popeye,” she scratched 
Her cleft chin’s solitary hair. She remembered spinach 
And was going to ask Wimpy if he had bought any spinach.   
“M’love,” he intercepted, “the plains are decked out in thunder   
Today, and it shall be as you wish.” He scratched 
The part of his head under his hat. The apartment 
Seemed to grow smaller. “But what if no pleasant 
Inspiration plunge us now to the stars? For this is my country.” 
Suddenly they remembered how it was cheaper in the country.   
Wimpy was thoughtfully cutting open a number 2 can of spinach   
When the door opened and Swee’pea crept in. “How pleasant!” 
But Swee’pea looked morose. A note was pinned to his bib. “Thunder   
And tears are unavailing,” it read. “Henceforth shall Popeye’s apartment   
Be but remembered space, toxic or salubrious, whole or scratched.” 
Olive came hurtling through the window; its geraniums scratched 
Her long thigh. “I have news!” she gasped. “Popeye, forced as you know to flee the country 
One musty gusty evening, by the schemes of his wizened, duplicate father, jealous of the apartment 
And all that it contains, myself and spinach 
In particular, heaves bolts of loving thunder 
At his own astonished becoming, rupturing the pleasant 
Arpeggio of our years. No more shall pleasant 
Rays of the sun refresh your sense of growing old, nor the scratched   
Tree-trunks and mossy foliage, only immaculate darkness and thunder.”   
She grabbed Swee’pea. “I’m taking the brat to the country.” 
“But you can’t do that—he hasn’t even finished his spinach,”   
Urged the Sea Hag, looking fearfully around at the apartment. 
But Olive was already out of earshot. Now the apartment 
Succumbed to a strange new hush. “Actually it’s quite pleasant 
Here,” thought the Sea Hag. “If this is all we need fear from spinach 
Then I don’t mind so much. Perhaps we could invite Alice the Goon over”—she scratched 
One dug pensively—“but Wimpy is such a country 
Bumpkin, always burping like that.” Minute at first, the thunder 
Soon filled the apartment. It was domestic thunder,   
The color of spinach. Popeye chuckled and scratched 
His balls: it sure was pleasant to spend a day in the country.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Oh there once was a woman
and she kept a shop
selling trinkets to tourists
not far from a dock
who came to see what life could be
far back on the island.
And it was always a party there
always different but very nice
New friends to give you advice
or fall in love with you which is nice
and each grew so perfectly from the other
it was a marvel of poetry 
and irony
And in this unsafe quarter
much was scary and dirty
but no one seemed to mind
very much
the parties went on from house to house
There were friends and lovers galore
all around the store
There was moonshine in winter
and starshine in summer
and everybody was happy to have discovered
what they discovered
And then one day the ship sailed away
There were no more dreamers just sleepers
in heavy attitudes on the dock 
moving as if they knew how
among the trinkets and the souvenirs
the random shops of modern furniture
and a gale came and said
it is time to take all of you away
from the tops of the trees to the little houses
on little paths so startled
And when it became time to go
they none of them would leave without the other
for they said we are all one here
and if one of us goes the other will not go
and the wind whispered it to the stars
the people all got up to go
and looked back on love</poem_text>

		<title>If You Said You Would Come With Me</title>
		<poem_text>In town it was very urban but in the country cows were covering the hills. The clouds were near and very moist. I was walking along the pavement with Anna, enjoying the scattered scenery. Suddenly a sound like a deep bell came from behind us. We both turned to look. “It’s the words you spoke in the past, coming back to haunt you,” Anna explained. “They always do, you know.”        Indeed I did. Many times this deep bell-like tone had intruded itself on my thoughts, scrambling them at first, then rearranging them in apple-pie order. “Two crows,” the voice seemed to say, “were sitting on a sundial in the God-given sunlight. Then one flew away.”       “Yes . . . and then?” I wanted to ask, but I kept silent. We turned into a courtyard and walked up several flights of stairs to the roof, where a party was in progress. “This is my friend Hans,” Anna said by way of introduction. No one paid much attention and several guests moved away to the balustrade to admire the view of orchards and vineyards, approaching their autumn glory. One of the women however came to greet us in a friendly manner. I was wondering if this was a “harvest home,” a phrase I had often heard but never understood.       “Welcome to my home . . . well, to our home,” the woman said gaily. “As you can see, the grapes are being harvested.” It seemed she could read my mind. “They say this year’s vintage will be a mediocre one, but the sight is lovely, nonetheless. Don’t you agree, Mr. . . .”       “Hans,” I replied curtly. The prospect was indeed a lovely one, but I wanted to leave. Making some excuse I guided Anna by the elbow toward the stairs and we left.       “That wasn’t polite of you,” she said dryly.       “Honey, I’ve had enough of people who can read your mind. When I want it done I’ll go to a mind reader.”       “I happen to be one and I can tell you what you’re thinking is false. Listen to what the big bell says: ‘We are all strangers on our own turf, in our own time.’ You should have paid attention. Now adjustments will have to be made.”</poem_text>

		<title>Last Month</title>
		<poem_text>No changes of support—only 
Patches of gray, here where sunlight fell. 
The house seems heavier 
Now that they have gone away.   
In fact it emptied in record time.   
When the flat table used to result 
A match recedes, slowly, into the night. 
The academy of the future is   
Opening its doors and willing 
The fruitless sunlight streams into domes,   
The chairs piled high with books and papers. 
The sedate one is this month’s skittish one   
Confirming the property that, 
A timeless value, has changed hands. 
And you could have a new automobile 
Ping pong set and garage, but the thief   
Stole everything like a miracle. 
In his book there was a picture of treason only   
And in the garden, cries and colors.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Alone with our madness and favorite flower 
We see that there really is nothing left to write about. 
Or rather, it is necessary to write about the same old things 
In the same way, repeating the same things over and over 
For love to continue and be gradually different. 
Beehives and ants have to be re-examined eternally 
And the color of the day put in 
Hundreds of times and varied from summer to winter 
For it to get slowed down to the pace of an authentic 
Saraband and huddle there, alive and resting. 
Only then can the chronic inattention 
Of our lives drape itself around us, conciliatory 
And with one eye on those long tan plush shadows 
That speak so deeply into our unprepared knowledge 
Of ourselves, the talking engines of our day.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Furthermore, Mr. Tuttle used to have to run in the streets.   
Now, each time friendship happens, they’re fully booked.   
Sporting with amaryllis in the shade is all fine and good,   
but when your sparring partner gets there first   
you wonder if it was all worth it. “Yes, why do it?”   
I’m on hold. It will take quite a lot for this music   
to grow on me. I meant no harm. I’ve helped him   
from getting stuck before. Dumb thing. All my appetites are friendly.   
Children too are free to go and come as they please.   
I ask you only to choose between us, then shut down this election.   
But don’t reveal too much of your hand at any given time.   
Then up and pipes the major, leave the hand in,   
or change the vows. The bold, enduring menace of courtship is upon us   
like the plague, and none of us can say what trouble   
will be precipitated once it has had its way with us.   
Our home is marshland. After dinner was wraparound.   
You got a tender little look at it.   
Outside, it never did turn golden.</poem_text>

		<title>Like a Sentence</title>
		<poem_text>How little we know,   
and when we know it! 
It was prettily said that “No man 
hath an abundance of cows on the plain, nor shards 
in his cupboard.” Wait! I think I know who said that! It was . . . 
Never mind, dears, the afternoon 
will fold you up, along with preoccupations   
that now seem so important, until only a child   
running around on a unicycle occupies center stage.   
Then what will you make of walls? And I fear you   
will have to come up with something, 
be it a terraced gambit above the sea 
or gossip overheard in the marketplace. 
For you see, it becomes you to be chastened: 
for the old to envy the young, 
and for youth to fear not getting older, 
where the paths through the elms, the carnivals, begin. 
And it was said of Gyges that his ring 
attracted those who saw him not, 
just as those who wandered through him were aware 
only of a certain stillness, such as precedes an earache, 
while lumberjacks in headbands came down to see what all the fuss was about, 
whether it was something they could be part of 
sans affront to self-esteem. 
And those temple hyenas who had seen enough, 
nostrils aflare, fur backing up in the breeze, 
were no place you could count on, 
having taken a proverbial powder 
as rifle butts received another notch. 
I, meanwhile . . . I was going to say I had squandered spring   
when summer came along and took it from me   
like a terrier a lady has asked one to hold for a moment 
while she adjusts her stocking in the mirror of a weighing machine.   
But here it is winter, and wrong 
to speak of other seasons as though they exist.   
Time has only an agenda 
in the wallet at his back, while we 
who think we know where we are going unfazed 
end up in brilliant woods, nourished more than we can know 
by the unexpectedness of ice and stars 
and crackling tears. We’ll just have to make a go of it, 
a run for it. And should the smell of baking cookies appease 
one or the other of the olfactory senses, climb down   
into this wagonload of prisoners. 
The meter will be screamingly clear then, 
the rhythms unbounced, for though we came 
to life as to a school, we must leave it without graduating   
even as an ominous wind puffs out the sails 
of proud feluccas who don’t know where they’re headed,   
only that a motion is etched there, shaking to be free.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>He says he doesn’t feel like working today. 
It’s just as well. Here in the shade 
Behind the house, protected from street noises,    
One can go over all kinds of old feeling, 
Throw some away, keep others. 
                                             The wordplay 
Between us gets very intense when there are   
Fewer feelings around to confuse things. 
Another go-round? No, but the last things 
You always find to say are charming, and rescue me   
Before the night does. We are afloat 
On our dreams as on a barge made of ice, 
Shot through with questions and fissures of starlight   
That keep us awake, thinking about the dreams 
As they are happening. Some occurrence. You said it. 
I said it but I can hide it. But I choose not to.   
Thank you. You are a very pleasant person.   
Thank you. You are too.</poem_text>

		<title>Pyrography</title>
		<poem_text>Out here on Cottage Grove it matters. The galloping 
Wind balks at its shadow. The carriages 
Are drawn forward under a sky of fumed oak. 
This is America calling: 
The mirroring of state to state,   
Of voice to voice on the wires, 
The force of colloquial greetings like golden 
Pollen sinking on the afternoon breeze. 
In service stairs the sweet corruption thrives; 
The page of dusk turns like a creaking revolving stage in Warren, Ohio. 
If this is the way it is let’s leave, 
They agree, and soon the slow boxcar journey begins,   
Gradually accelerating until the gyrating fans of suburbs   
Enfolding the darkness of cities are remembered   
Only as a recurring tic. And midway 
We meet the disappointed, returning ones, without its   
Being able to stop us in the headlong night 
Toward the nothing of the coast. At Bolinas 
The houses doze and seem to wonder why through the   
Pacific haze, and the dreams alternately glow and grow dull.   
Why be hanging on here? Like kites, circling,   
Slipping on a ramp of air, but always circling? 
But the variable cloudiness is pouring it on, 
Flooding back to you like the meaning of a joke. 
The land wasn’t immediately appealing; we built it 
Partly over with fake ruins, in the image of ourselves: 
An arch that terminates in mid-keystone, a crumbling stone pier   
For laundresses, an open-air theater, never completed 
And only partially designed. How are we to inhabit 
This space from which the fourth wall is invariably missing,   
As in a stage-set or dollhouse, except by staving as we are,   
In lost profile, facing the stars, with dozens of as yet 
Unrealized projects, and a strict sense 
Of time running out, of evening presenting   
The tactfully folded-over bill? And we fit   
Rather too easily into it, become transparent,   
Almost ghosts. One day 
The birds and animals in the pasture have absorbed   
The color, the density of the surroundings,   
The leaves are alive, and too heavy with life. 
A long period of adjustment followed. 
In the cities at the turn of the century they knew about it   
But were careful not to let on as the iceman and the milkman   
Disappeared down the block and the postman shouted   
His daily rounds. The children under the trees knew it   
But all the fathers returning home 
On streetcars after a satisfying day at the office undid it:   
The climate was still floral and all the wallpaper   
In a million homes all over the land conspired to hide it.   
One day we thought of painted furniture, of how   
It just slightly changes everything in the room 
And in the yard outside, and how, if we were going 
To be able to write the history of our time, starting with today,   
It would be necessary to model all these unimportant details   
So as to be able to include them; otherwise the narrative   
Would have that flat, sandpapered look the sky gets   
Out in the middle west toward the end of summer,   
The look of wanting to back out before the argument   
Has been resolved, and at the same time to save appearances 
So that tomorrow will be pure. Therefore, since we have to do our business   
In spite of things, why not make it in spite of everything?   
That way, maybe the feeble lakes and swamps 
Of the back country will get plugged into the circuit   
And not just the major events but the whole incredible 
Mass of everything happening simultaneously and pairing off, 
Channeling itself into history, will unroll 
As carefully and as casually as a conversation in the next room,   
And the purity of today will invest us like a breeze, 
Only be hard, spare, ironical: something one can 
Tip one’s hat to and still get some use out of. 
The parade is turning into our street. 
My stars, the burnished uniforms and prismatic   
Features of this instant belong here. The land 
Is pulling away from the magic, glittering coastal towns 
To an aforementioned rendezvous with August and December.   
The hunch is it will always be this way,   
The look, the way things first scared you   
In the night light, and later turned out to be,   
Yet still capable, all the same, of a narrow fidelity   
To what you and they wanted to become:   
No sighs like Russian music, only a vast unravelling   
Out toward the junctions and to the darkness beyond   
To these bare fields, built at today’s expense.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>On the secret map the assassins   
Cloistered, the Moon River was marked   
Near the eighteen peaks and the city 
Of humiliation and defeat—wan ending   
Of the trail among dry, papery leaves   
Gray-brown quills like thoughts 
In the melodious but vast mass of today’s   
Writing through fields and swamps 
Marked, on the map, with little bunches of weeds.   
Certainly squirrels lived in the woods   
But devastation and dull sleep still   
Hung over the land, quelled 
The rioters turned out of sleep in the peace of prisons   
Singing on marble factory walls   
Deaf consolation of minor tunes that pack   
The air with heavy invisible rods   
Pent in some sand valley from 
Which only quiet walking ever instructs.   
The bird flew over and 
Sat—there was nothing else to do. 
Do not mistake its silence for pride or strength 
Or the waterfall for a harbor 
Full of light boats that is there 
Performing for thousands of people   
In clothes some with places to go   
Or games. Sometimes over the pillar   
Of square stones its impact 
Makes a light print. 
So going around cities 
To get to other places you found   
It all on paper but the land 
Was made of paper processed   
To look like ferns, mud or other   
Whose sea unrolled its magic   
Distances and then rolled them up   
Its secret was only a pocket 
After all but some corners are darker 
Than these moonless nights spent as on a raft 
In the seclusion of a melody heard   
As though through trees 
And you can never ignite their touch   
Long but there were homes 
Flung far out near the asperities   
Of a sharp, rocky pinnacle 
And other collective places 
Shadows of vineyards whose wine   
Tasted of the forest floor 
Fisheries and oyster beds 
Tides under the pole 
Seminaries of instruction, public   
Places for electric light 
And the major tax assessment area   
Wrinkled on the plan 
Of election to public office 
Sixty-two years old bath and breakfast   
The formal traffic, shadows 
To make it not worth joining 
After the ox had pulled away the cart. 
Your plan was to separate the enemy into two groups   
With the razor-edged mountains between. 
It worked well on paper 
But their camp had grown 
To be the mountains and the map   
Carefully peeled away and not torn   
Was the light, a tender but tough bark 
On everything. Fortunately the war was solved   
In another way by isolating the two sections   
Of the enemy’s navy so that the mainland   
Warded away the big floating ships.   
Light bounced off the ends   
Of the small gray waves to tell   
Them in the observatory   
About the great drama that was being won 
To turn off the machinery 
And quietly move among the rustic landscape   
Scooping snow off the mountains rinsing 
The coarser ones that love had   
Slowly risen in the night to overflow   
Wetting pillow and petal   
Determined to place the letter 
On the unassassinated president’s desk 
So that a stamp could reproduce all this 
In detail, down to the last autumn leaf 
And the affliction of June ride 
Slowly out into the sun-blackened landscape.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Cervantes was asleep when he wrote Don Quixote. 
Joyce slept during the Wandering Rocks section of Ulysses. 
Homer nodded and occasionally slept during the greater part of the Iliad; he was awake however when he wrote the Odyssey. 
Proust snored his way through The Captive, as have legions of his readers after him. 
Melville was asleep at the wheel for much of Moby-Dick. 
Fitzgerald slept through Tender Is the Night, which is perhaps not so surprising, 
but the fact that Mann slumbered on the very slopes of The Magic Mountain is quite extraordinary—that he wrote it, even more so.   
Kafka, of course, never slept, even while not writing or on bank holidays. 
No one knows too much about George Eliot’s writing habits—my guess is she would sleep a few minutes, wake up and write something, then pop back to sleep again. 
Lew Wallace’s forty winks came, incredibly, during the chariot race in Ben-Hur. 
Emily Dickinson slept on her cold, narrow bed in Amherst. 
When she awoke there would be a new poem inscribed by Jack Frost on the windowpane; outside, glass foliage chimed. 
Good old Walt snored as he wrote and, like so many of us, insisted he didn’t. 
Maugham snored on the Riviera. 
Agatha Christie slept daintily, as a woman sleeps, which is why her novels are like tea sandwiches—artistic, for the most part. 
I sleep when I cannot avoid it; my writing and sleeping are constantly improving. 
I have other things to say, but shall not detain you much. 
Never go out in a boat with an author—they cannot tell when they are over water. 
Birds make poor role models. 
A philosopher should be shown the door, but don’t, under any circumstances, try it. 
Slaves make good servants. 
Brushing the teeth may not always improve the appearance. 
Store clean rags in old pillow cases. 
Feed a dog only when he barks. 
Flush tea leaves down the toilet, coffee grounds down the sink. 
Beware of anonymous letters—you may have written them, in a wordless implosion of sleep.</poem_text>

		<title>Soonest Mended</title>
		<poem_text>Barely tolerated, living on the margin 
In our technological society, we were always having to be rescued   
On the brink of destruction, like heroines in Orlando Furioso 
Before it was time to start all over again. 
There would be thunder in the bushes, a rustling of coils,   
And Angelica, in the Ingres painting, was considering 
The colorful but small monster near her toe, as though wondering whether forgetting 
The whole thing might not, in the end, be the only solution.   
And then there always came a time when 
Happy Hooligan in his rusted green automobile 
Came plowing down the course, just to make sure everything was O.K.,   
Only by that time we were in another chapter and confused   
About how to receive this latest piece of information.   
Was it information? Weren’t we rather acting this out   
For someone else’s benefit, thoughts in a mind 
With room enough and to spare for our little problems (so they began to seem), 
Our daily quandary about food and the rent and bills to be paid?   
To reduce all this to a small variant, 
To step free at last, minuscule on the gigantic plateau— 
This was our ambition: to be small and clear and free.   
Alas, the summer’s energy wanes quickly, 
A moment and it is gone. And no longer 
May we make the necessary arrangements, simple as they are.   
Our star was brighter perhaps when it had water in it.   
Now there is no question even of that, but only 
Of holding on to the hard earth so as not to get thrown off,   
With an occasional dream, a vision: a robin flies across   
The upper corner of the window, you brush your hair away 
And cannot quite see, or a wound will flash 
Against the sweet faces of the others, something like:   
This is what you wanted to hear, so why 
Did you think of listening to something else? We are all talkers   
It is true, but underneath the talk lies 
The moving and not wanting to be moved, the loose 
Meaning, untidy and simple like a threshing floor. 
These then were some hazards of the course, 
Yet though we knew the course was hazards and nothing else   
It was still a shock when, almost a quarter of a century later,   
The clarity of the rules dawned on you for the first time.   
They were the players, and we who had struggled at the game   
Were merely spectators, though subject to its vicissitudes 
And moving with it out of the tearful stadium, borne on shoulders, at last. 
Night after night this message returns, repeated 
In the flickering bulbs of the sky, raised past us, taken away from us,   
Yet ours over and over until the end that is past truth,   
The being of our sentences, in the climate that fostered them,   
Not ours to own, like a book, but to be with, and sometimes   
To be without, alone and desperate. 
But the fantasy makes it ours, a kind of fence-sitting 
Raised to the level of an esthetic ideal. These were moments, years,   
Solid with reality, faces, namable events, kisses, heroic acts,   
But like the friendly beginning of a geometrical progression 
Not too reassuring, as though meaning could be cast aside some day   
When it had been outgrown. Better, you said, to stay cowering   
Like this in the early lessons, since the promise of learning   
Is a delusion, and I agreed, adding that 
Tomorrow would alter the sense of what had already been learned,   
That the learning process is extended in this way, so that from this standpoint 
None of us ever graduates from college, 
For time is an emulsion, and probably thinking not to grow up   
Is the brightest kind of maturity for us, right now at any rate. 
And you see, both of us were right, though nothing 
Has somehow come to nothing; the avatars 
Of our conforming to the rules and living 
Around the home have made—well, in a sense, “good citizens” of us,   
Brushing the teeth and all that, and learning to accept 
The charity of the hard moments as they are doled out, 
For this is action, this not being sure, this careless 
Preparing, sowing the seeds crooked in the furrow, 
Making ready to forget, and always coming back 
To the mooring of starting out, that day so long ago.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>One died, and the soul was wrenched out   
Of the other in life, who, walking the streets   
Wrapped in an identity like a coat, sees on and on   
The same corners, volumetrics, shadows   
Under trees. Farther than anyone was ever   
Called, through increasingly suburban airs   
And ways, with autumn falling over everything:   
The plush leaves the chattels in barrels   
Of an obscure family being evicted 
Into the way it was, and is. The other beached   
Glimpses of what the other was up to: 
Revelations at last. So they grew to hate and forget each other. 
So I cradle this average violin that knows   
Only forgotten showtunes, but argues 
The possibility of free declamation anchored 
To a dull refrain, the year turning over on itself   
In November, with the spaces among the days   
More literal, the meat more visible on the bone.   
Our question of a place of origin hangs 
Like smoke: how we picnicked in pine forests, 
In coves with the water always seeping up, and left   
Our trash, sperm and excrement everywhere, smeared   
On the landscape, to make of us what we could.</poem_text>

Of this. Then one day, everything changed. He rends   
Rocks into fissures with lament. Gullies, hummocks   
Can’t withstand it. The sky shudders from one horizon   
To the other, almost ready to give up wholeness.   
Then Apollo quietly told him: “Leave it all on earth.   
Your lute, what point? Why pick at a dull pavan few care to   
Follow, except a few birds of dusty feather, 
Not vivid performances of the past.” But why not?   
All other things must change too. 
The seasons are no longer what they once were,   
But it is the nature of things to be seen only once, 
As they happen along, bumping into other things, getting along   
Somehow. That’s where Orpheus made his mistake.   
Of course Eurydice vanished into the shade; 
She would have even if he hadn’t turned around. 
No use standing there like a gray stone toga as the whole wheel   
Of recorded history flashes past, struck dumb, unable to utter an intelligent 
Comment on the most thought-provoking element in its train.   
Only love stays on the brain, and something these people,   
These other ones, call life. Singing accurately 
So that the notes mount straight up out of the well of   
Dim noon and rival the tiny, sparkling yellow flowers   
Growing around the brink of the quarry, encapsulates   
The different weights of the things. 
                                                       But it isn’t enough   
To just go on singing. Orpheus realized this 
And didn’t mind so much about his reward being in heaven   
After the Bacchantes had torn him apart, driven   
Half out of their minds by his music, what it was doing to them. 
Some say it was for his treatment of Eurydice. 
But probably the music had more to do with it, and   
The way music passes, emblematic 
Of life and how you cannot isolate a note of it 
And say it is good or bad. You must 
Wait till it’s over. “The end crowns all,” 
Meaning also that the “tableau” 
Is wrong. For although memories, of a season, for example,   
Melt into a single snapshot, one cannot guard, treasure   
That stalled moment. It too is flowing, fleeting;   
It is a picture of flowing, scenery, though living, mortal,   
Over which an abstract action is laid out in blunt,   
Harsh strokes. And to ask more than this 
Is to become the tossing reeds of that slow, 
Powerful stream, the trailing grasses 
Playfully tugged at, but to participate in the action   
No more than this. Then in the lowering gentian sky   
Electric twitches are faintly apparent first, then burst forth   
Into a shower of fixed, cream-colored flares. The horses   
Have each seen a share of the truth, though each thinks,   
“I’m a maverick. Nothing of this is happening to me,   
Though I can understand the language of birds, and   
The itinerary of the lights caught in the storm is fully apparent to me. 
Their jousting ends in music much 
As trees move more easily in the wind after a summer storm   
And is happening in lacy shadows of shore-trees, now, day after day.” 
But how late to be regretting all this, even 
Bearing in mind that regrets are always late, too late!   
To which Orpheus, a bluish cloud with white contours,   
Replies that these are of course not regrets at all,   
Merely a careful, scholarly setting down of 
Unquestioned facts, a record of pebbles along the way. 
And no matter how all this disappeared,   
Or got where it was going, it is no longer   
Material for a poem. Its subject 
Matters too much, and not enough, standing there helplessly   
While the poem streaked by, its tail afire, a bad   
Comet screaming hate and disaster, but so turned inward   
That the meaning, good or other, can never   
Become known. The singer thinks 
Constructively, builds up his chant in progressive stages   
Like a skyscraper, but at the last minute turns away.   
The song is engulfed in an instant in blackness   
Which must in turn flood the whole continent   
With blackness, for it cannot see. The singer   
Must then pass out of sight, not even relieved   
Of the evil burthen of the words. Stellification   
Is for the few, and comes about much later   
When all record of these people and their lives   
Has disappeared into libraries, onto microfilm.   
A few are still interested in them. “But what about   
So-and-so?” is still asked on occasion. But they lie   
Frozen and out of touch until an arbitrary chorus 
Speaks of a totally different incident with a similar name   
In whose tale are hidden syllables 
Of what happened so long before that 
In some small town, one indifferent summer.</poem_text>

		<title>The Bungalows</title>
		<poem_text>Impatient as we were for all of them to join us, 
The land had not yet risen into view: gulls had swept the gray steel towers away 
So that it profited less to go searching, away over the humming earth 
Than to stay in immediate relation to these other things—boxes, store parts, whatever you wanted to call them— 
Whose installedness was the price of further revolutions, so you knew this combat was the last. 
And still the relationship waxed, billowed like scenery on the breeze. 
They are the same aren’t they, 
The presumed landscape and the dream of home 
Because the people are all homesick today or desperately sleeping,   
Trying to remember how those rectangular shapes 
Became so extraneous and so near 
To create a foreground of quiet knowledge 
In which youth had grown old, chanting and singing wise hymns that   
Will sign for old age 
And so lift up the past to be persuaded, and be put down again. 
The warning is nothing more than an aspirate “h”; 
The problem is sketched completely, like fireworks mounted on poles:   
Complexion of evening, the accurate voices of the others. 
During Coca-Cola lessons it becomes patent 
Of noise on the left, and we had so skipped a stage that   
The great wave of the past, compounded in derision,   
Submerged idea and non-dreamer alike   
In falsetto starlight like “purity” 
Of design that had been the first danger sign 
To wash the sticky, icky stuff down the drain—pfui! 
How does it feel to be outside and inside at the same time, 
The delicious feeling of the air contradicting and secretly abetting 
The interior warmth? But the land curdles the dismay in which it’s written   
Bearing to a final point of folly and doom 
The wisdom of these generations. 
Look at what you’ve done to the landscape— 
The ice cube, the olive— 
There is a perfect tri-city mesh of things 
Extending all the way along the river on both sides 
With the end left for thoughts on construction 
That are always turning to alps and thresholds 
Above the tide of others, feeding a European moss rose without glory. 
We shall very soon have the pleasure of recording 
A period of unanimous tergiversation in this respect 
And to make that pleasure the greater, it is worth while 
At the risk of tedious iteration, to put first upon record a final protest:   
Rather decaying art, genius, inspiration to hold to 
An impossible “calque” of reality, than 
“The new school of the trivial, rising up on the field of battle,   
Something of sludge and leaf-mold,” and life 
Goes trickling out through the holes, like water through a sieve,   
All in one direction. 
You who were directionless, and thought it would solve everything if you found one, 
What do you make of this? Just because a thing is immortal 
Is that any reason to worship it? Death, after all, is immortal.   
But you have gone into your houses and shut the doors, meaning   
There can be no further discussion. 
And the river pursues its lonely course 
With the sky and the trees cast up from the landscape 
For green brings unhappiness—le vert Porte malheur. 
“The chartreuse mountain on the absinthe plain 
Makes the strong man’s tears tumble down like rain.” 
All this came to pass eons ago. 
Your program worked out perfectly. You even avoided 
The monotony of perfection by leaving in certain flaws: 
A backward way of becoming, a forced handshake, 
An absent-minded smile, though in fact nothing was left to chance. 
Each detail was startlingly clear, as though seen through a magnifying glass,   
Or would have been to an ideal observer, namely yourself— 
For only you could watch yourself so patiently from afar 
The way God watches a sinner on the path to redemption, 
Sometimes disappearing into valleys, but always on the way, 
For it all builds up into something, meaningless or meaningful 
As architecture, because planned and then abandoned when completed,   
To live afterwards, in sunlight and shadow, a certain amount of years.   
Who cares about what was there before? There is no going back,   
For standing still means death, and life is moving on, 
Moving on towards death. But sometimes standing still is also life.</poem_text>

		<title>The Instruction Manual</title>
		<poem_text>As I sit looking out of a window of the building 
I wish I did not have to write the instruction manual on the uses of a new metal. 
I look down into the street and see people, each walking with an inner peace,   
And envy them—they are so far away from me! 
Not one of them has to worry about getting out this manual on schedule.   
And, as my way is, I begin to dream, resting my elbows on the desk and leaning out of the window a little, 
Of dim Guadalajara! City of rose-colored flowers! 
City I wanted most to see, and most did not see, in Mexico! 
But I fancy I see, under the press of having to write the instruction manual,   
Your public square, city, with its elaborate little bandstand! 
The band is playing Scheherazade by Rimsky-Korsakov. 
Around stand the flower girls, handing out rose- and lemon-colored flowers,   
Each attractive in her rose-and-blue striped dress (Oh! such shades of rose and blue), 
And nearby is the little white booth where women in green serve you green and yellow fruit. 
The couples are parading; everyone is in a holiday mood. 
First, leading the parade, is a dapper fellow 
Clothed in deep blue. On his head sits a white hat 
And he wears a mustache, which has been trimmed for the occasion. 
His dear one, his wife, is young and pretty; her shawl is rose, pink, and white.   
Her slippers are patent leather, in the American fashion, 
And she carries a fan, for she is modest, and does not want the crowd to see her face too often. 
But everybody is so busy with his wife or loved one 
I doubt they would notice the mustachioed man’s wife. 
Here come the boys! They are skipping and throwing little things on the sidewalk 
Which is made of gray tile. One of them, a little older, has a toothpick in his teeth. 
He is silenter than the rest, and affects not to notice the pretty young girls in white. 
But his friends notice them, and shout their jeers at the laughing girls.   
Yet soon all this will cease, with the deepening of their years, 
And love bring each to the parade grounds for another reason. 
But I have lost sight of the young fellow with the toothpick. 
Wait—there he is—on the other side of the bandstand, 
Secluded from his friends, in earnest talk with a young girl 
Of fourteen or fifteen. I try to hear what they are saying 
But it seems they are just mumbling something—shy words of love, probably. 
She is slightly taller than he, and looks quietly down into his sincere eyes.   
She is wearing white. The breeze ruffles her long fine black hair against her olive cheek. 
Obviously she is in love. The boy, the young boy with the toothpick, he is in love too; 
His eyes show it. Turning from this couple, 
I see there is an intermission in the concert. 
The paraders are resting and sipping drinks through straws 
(The drinks are dispensed from a large glass crock by a lady in dark blue),   
And the musicians mingle among them, in their creamy white uniforms, and talk 
About the weather, perhaps, or how their kids are doing at school. 
Let us take this opportunity to tiptoe into one of the side streets.   
Here you may see one of those white houses with green trim   
That are so popular here. Look—I told you! 
It is cool and dim inside, but the patio is sunny. 
An old woman in gray sits there, fanning herself with a palm leaf fan.   
She welcomes us to her patio, and offers us a cooling drink.   
“My son is in Mexico City,” she says. “He would welcome you too   
If he were here. But his job is with a bank there. 
Look, here is a photograph of him.” 
And a dark-skinned lad with pearly teeth grins out at us from the worn leather frame. 
We thank her for her hospitality, for it is getting late 
And we must catch a view of the city, before we leave, from a good high place. 
That church tower will do—the faded pink one, there against the fierce blue of the sky. Slowly we enter. 
The caretaker, an old man dressed in brown and gray, asks us how long we have been in the city, and how we like it here. 
His daughter is scrubbing the steps—she nods to us as we pass into the tower. 
Soon we have reached the top, and the whole network of the city extends before us. 
There is the rich quarter, with its houses of pink and white, and its crumbling, leafy terraces. 
There is the poorer quarter, its homes a deep blue. 
There is the market, where men are selling hats and swatting flies 
And there is the public library, painted several shades of pale green and beige. 
Look! There is the square we just came from, with the promenaders.   
There are fewer of them, now that the heat of the day has increased,   
But the young boy and girl still lurk in the shadows of the bandstand.   
And there is the home of the little old lady— 
She is still sitting in the patio, fanning herself. 
How limited, but how complete withal, has been our experience of Guadalajara! 
We have seen young love, married love, and the love of an aged mother for her son. 
We have heard the music, tasted the drinks, and looked at colored houses.   
What more is there to do, except stay? And that we cannot do. 
And as a last breeze freshens the top of the weathered old tower, I turn my 
gaze 
Back to the instruction manual which has made me dream of Guadalajara.</poem_text>

		<title>The Painter</title>
		<poem_text>Sitting between the sea and the buildings 
He enjoyed painting the sea’s portrait. 
But just as children imagine a prayer 
Is merely silence, he expected his subject 
To rush up the sand, and, seizing a brush, 
Plaster its own portrait on the canvas. 
So there was never any paint on his canvas 
Until the people who lived in the buildings 
Put him to work: “Try using the brush 
As a means to an end. Select, for a portrait, 
Something less angry and large, and more subject 
To a painter’s moods, or, perhaps, to a prayer.” 
How could he explain to them his prayer 
That nature, not art, might usurp the canvas? 
He chose his wife for a new subject, 
Making her vast, like ruined buildings, 
As if, forgetting itself, the portrait 
Had expressed itself without a brush. 
Slightly encouraged, he dipped his brush 
In the sea, murmuring a heartfelt prayer: 
“My soul, when I paint this next portrait 
Let it be you who wrecks the canvas.” 
The news spread like wildfire through the buildings: 
He had gone back to the sea for his subject. 
Imagine a painter crucified by his subject! 
Too exhausted even to lift his brush, 
He provoked some artists leaning from the buildings 
To malicious mirth: “We haven’t a prayer 
Now, of putting ourselves on canvas, 
Or getting the sea to sit for a portrait!” 
Others declared it a self-portrait. 
Finally all indications of a subject 
Began to fade, leaving the canvas 
Perfectly white. He put down the brush. 
At once a howl, that was also a prayer, 
Arose from the overcrowded buildings. 
They tossed him, the portrait, from the tallest of the buildings; 
And the sea devoured the canvas and the brush 
As though his subject had decided to remain a prayer.</poem_text>

		<title>These Lacustrine Cities</title>
		<poem_text>These lacustrine cities grew out of loathing 
Into something forgetful, although angry with history. 
They are the product of an idea: that man is horrible, for instance,   
Though this is only one example. 
They emerged until a tower 
Controlled the sky, and with artifice dipped back 
Into the past for swans and tapering branches, 
Burning, until all that hate was transformed into useless love. 
Then you are left with an idea of yourself 
And the feeling of ascending emptiness of the afternoon   
Which must be charged to the embarrassment of others   
Who fly by you like beacons. 
The night is a sentinel. 
Much of your time has been occupied by creative games 
Until now, but we have all-inclusive plans for you. 
We had thought, for instance, of sending you to the middle of the desert, 
To a violent sea, or of having the closeness of the others be air   
To you, pressing you back into a startled dream 
As sea-breezes greet a child’s face. 
But the past is already here, and you are nursing some private project. 
The worst is not over, yet I know 
You will be happy here. Because of the logic 
Of your situation, which is something no climate can outsmart.   
Tender and insouciant by turns, you see 
You have built a mountain of something, 
Thoughtfully pouring all your energy into this single monument,   
Whose wind is desire starching a petal, 
Whose disappointment broke into a rainbow of tears.</poem_text>

That way, I said,   
there can be no waste.   
Waste is virtually eliminated.   
To come back for a few hours to   
the present subject, a painting,   
looking like it was seen,   
half turning around, slightly apprehensive,

		<title>Murderer [Part IV]</title>
		<poem_text>IV
So it did not come as a surprise—a relief, almost—when we heard the tac-tac-tac of machine guns and the thud of grenades rising up from the woods below. The Germans were advancing again through the tangle of bomb-shattered branches, clearing a path with axe-blows, foreheads crushed beneath the overhang of great steel helmets, gleaming eyes fixed dead ahead.
     The rest of that day was bitter, and many of us fell forever headlong in the grass. But toward evening the voice of battle began to diminish, and then from the depths of the forest we could hear the song of the wounded: the serene, monotonous, sad-hopeful song of the wounded, joining the chorus of birds hidden in the foliage as they welcomed the return of the moon.
     It was still daylight, but the moon was rising sweetly from behind the forested mountains of Reims.
  
 It was green against a white and tender sky… 
             
             A moon from the forest of Ardennes,
             a moon from the country of Rimbaud, of Verlaine,
             a delicate green moon, round and light,
             entering the room of the sky from behind a screen of branches
             as if stepping delicately out of the earth,
             rising up from the grass, causing the tree-branches to blush
             transparent and sweet.
  
             Like startled birds, we had settled again around Jaco:
             I can&#39;t stand it any more, he smiled.
             Don&#39;t let me suffer.
             But now his smile was tired:
             a tired smile
             in a face clenched like a fist.
  
             Jaco&#39;s suffering gnawed away at us,
             sinking into our bones.
             There is nothing so terrible, or so sweet,
             so touching, as that animal, man,
             when he gives over to death.
             I felt my shirt sticking to my back. My face
             and the faces of the others were beaded with sweat,
             like the sweet face of Nazzareno Jacoboni.
             And little by little I became aware
             that everyone had slowly turned toward me,
             pinning me down with their eyes.
  
             Along with Jaco&#39;s terrible, unbearable suffering,
             something else was sinking into us, little by little,
             something which was not ours.
             Something strong, strange, insistent,
             was slowly being born within us.
             Jaco stared at me,
             even he now stared at me,
             expecting something,
             and I felt a new idea forming inside me,
             and inside the others.
             
             I can&#39;t go on, said Jaco.
             I looked away to the green moon hanging behind the trees:
             It had taken on the round shapeliness
             of a fragrant leaf: a laurel leaf,
             perhaps, or sage, or mint,
             a great green leaf, transparent with evening daylight.
             The sun had not yet settled into the forest,
             and his last warm rays struck the trunks of the trees
             leaving some of them wounded, bleeding.
             Others—the oaks, the beeches, poplars and birches—
             reflected the light in a strange way,
             as if they were made of glass.
  
             That glassy light, which the sun, just before it sets,
             draws from the earth&#39;s waters,
             drinks from its grass, from its leaves,
             from the trunks of its trees,
             to slake its thirst.
  
             All of them stared at me,
             but I was not aware of what I was doing.
             I felt my hands moving,
             but I did not know what I was doing until
             I found myself standing
             and saw them looking up at me,
             and Jacoboni smiling at me strangely,
             and felt something cold and smooth in my hands.
  
             And finally I was aware that I was standing
             with a rifle in my hands.
             I closed my eyes, and fired.
             I fired with my eyes closed,
             one shot after another.
             
            And then, when the echo of the shots
             had melted into the woods,
             there was a great silence.
  
             With my eyes still closed,
             rifle still in hand,
             I turned and took a few steps.
             Suddenly I heard: Murderer! Murderer!
  
             It was the voice of woman, terrible,
             the voice of a sister, desperate,
             the voice of a mother, of a lover.
             And at that moment nothing could have been more terrible
             than that voice of a woman,
             that voice of a mother, of a sister,
             of a lover, crying:
  
             Murderer!
  
     I opened my eyes and saw one of the girls running toward me, her hands like claws, as if she intended to tear me apart. She screamed again: Murderer! and then stopped abruptly a few paces away, filthy, disheveled, with a great bewilderment, spreading across her face, a wondrous pity. I stood in front of her, rifle in my hands, tears in my eyes.
     And they were certainly a marvelous thing, those tears, not only for her, but for me as well.
  
 My mother . . . 
  
             My mother was lying on her back,
             her eyes were closed, and she seemed to be asleep;
             Even her hand, abandoned on the sheets,
             had dozed off.
             I fell silent,
             looking at the moon rising inch by inch
             over the olive trees of Settignano.
             It gave me great solace,
             that moon and those trees.
             That bright silver moon over silvery trees,
             that moon in the shape of an olive leaf,
             clean and transparent,
             shining like a vein of silver, pulsing
             through green marble
             in the incensed darkness of a church.</poem_text>

 The whole of human history … 
  
             The whole of human history 
             seems to be the story of men who kill,
             and of men who are killed;
             of murderers who light their cigarettes
             with trembling hands,
             and of poor, unlucky kids staring into the eyes
             of those who bring them their deaths.
  
             But history is not about murderers, after all.
             It is just the story of some poor kids.
             The whole history of the world
             is just the story of millions of poor kids
             overwhelmed by the fear of death, or
             by the fear of bringing death to others.
  
             My mother had closed her eyes
             and was breathing softly.
             Every so often, her right hand,
             abandoned on the white sheet,
             would shift slightly, opening and closing
             like the hand of a sleeping baby.
  
             The nurse came into the room just then,
             as I had begun to tell the story of Jaco.
             She opened the door as slowly as possible,
             but I felt her presence behind my shoulders
             bending over the bed,
             looking at my mother.
  
             She is sleeping, said the nurse.
             Don&#39;t wake her.
  
             I didn&#39;t turn around,
             but continued my story in a low whisper.
             When I got to the part about the grenade,
             I heard the nurse tiptoeing out,
             closing the door behind her,
  
             silently.
  
 The grenade exploded a few feet away, while Jaco was helping to carry two wounded soldiers down the hill to the hospital tent. By the time I got to him, he was stretched out on the grass, breathing heavily. Everyone around him had been killed. He watched as I approached, and when I was close, he smiled.
     He had just been promoted to lieutenant, even though he had not yet turned nineteen. Six months ago, when we were getting ready to leave Italy, Ercolani had taken me aside and said: Look out for Jaco. He&#39;s like a brother to me. Make sure nothing bad happens to him.
     I was irritated: War isn&#39;t a game. It doesn&#39;t play by the rules. If something bad happens to him, tough luck.
     But from that day on, I kept my eye on Jacoboni: he was about the same age as me, but seemed much younger. In any event, he turned out to be a good officer: he did his duty like all the others, like a good kid. He took war seriously, convinced he would go home in one piece, back to his family in Monterotondo, near Rome. And it was perhaps because of this that he smiled as I sat down next to him.
      I saw right away that it was hopeless. The grenade had torn open his abdomen and his intestines were cascading down his leg past his knees and coiling onto the ground.
       We were surrounded by the dead: hundreds of them in the forest around us. Most were Italian, but there were a few Germans: they had advanced this far before we had finally pushed them back. Their dead lay alongside ours.
  
 It began to rain.
  
             The rain on the oak leaves
             made a soft music, like women whispering.
             Every so often, it would intensify
             as it darted here, and there through the trees,
             rising and then fading away.
  
             The green reflection of the forest
             washed everything the color of water,
             gave an extraordinary lightness to things:
             to the solid trunks of the trees,
             to the bodies lying in the grass.
  
             Glimpsed through the branches of the trees,
             the sky appeared light and remote:
             A sky made of silk,
             luminous and pure, serene,
             scrubbed of clouds and fog.
  
             The rain was coming from who knows where.
             Or maybe it was not even rain,
             just the memory of some rain
             falling from the depths of past summers,
             falling from some childhood summer long ago.</poem_text>

		<title>Today We Fly</title>
		<poem_text>One Sunday morning,
 instead of studying The Illiad,
 I escaped with Bino to Florence,
 to see what miracles the aviator Manissero
 would perform.
  
 Whether he would demonstrate the art of Daedalus
 or the folly of Icarus.
  
 We found the whole city festooned with banners
 on which was written: Today We Fly.
 They were everywhere: Via Cerretani,
 Via Cavour, Via Calzaioli, along the embankments.
 There was even one stretched across the Arno
 with an enormous red Today We Fly
 reflected in the yellow water

like the famous In Hoc Signo Vinces of Ponte Milvio.
 
We almost expected that Florence itself
would lift off,
with its towers, its statues, its red roofs,
with its cathedral&#39;s nodding cupola
rising slowly through the clouds
like a balloon.
 
Every window, doorway and marketplace
was crammed with upturned faces,
scanning the sky for some sign
of the direction the wind might take,
and whether there would come with it
the smell of rain.
 
We were most afraid of the wind from Bologna,
proud enemy to the north.
Almost as bad would have been the wind from the south,
from Empoli, called the scirocco;
or Petrarch&#39;s east wind from Arezzo,
with its Grecian-accented gusts.
But even a soft westerly breeze from Pistoia—
even that sweet breath from the ballads of Cino,
full of dolce stil novo—
would have spelled disaster.
 
Luckily the sky that Sunday was clear,
and the air was still.
The leaves on the trees around the parade ground
stood at ease,
and the outlines of the hills were crisp,
sharply etched in the crystalline air.
Just wait. Today we really will fly,
said Bino with a smile.
 
For overnight Today We Fly had become a catchphrase,
fit for every occasion:
for a straw hat rolling along the pavement;
for a parasol blown around the corner;
for a dress tangled up between the knees,
or blown flapping like a flag around rounded hips.
 
It was the happy time of the first aeroplanes,
before the War
when it was fashionable for women
to wear enormous hairdos
as wide as their dresses were narrow.
And those gigantic wings of hair,
which were the objects of so many of our teenage jokes,
have remained braided together in my heart
with the fluttering Today We Fly:
maliciously good-natured mementos
of my adolescence.
 
We hurried over the parade grounds,
and there was Manissero
crouched in the cockpit of his machine:
a contraption of woven reeds and papery cloth,
with a motor so small it made you think a horsefly
was pinned to the frame behind his shoulders.
 
The crowd had assembled, holding its breath,
waiting for the miracle to happen,
when suddenly the leaves began to tremble,
and the blades of grass of nod.
A few tiny white clouds sprouted
like windowsills on Monte Morello,
and the women&#39;s wings of hair began to come untucked
from their padded nests of false braids.
 
Manissero jumped out of his cockpit
at the first sign of this unfortunate breeze,
waved amicably to the crowd with a gloved hand,
and yanked off his leather helmet
while a banner was unfurled above the grandstands:
 
Because of Unsettled Weather, Today We Will Not Fly.
 
It was hard to imagine anything more settled
than the weather that day:
a magnificent, paradisiacal Sunday in spring.
But all it took was this delicate breeze,
this perfumed zephyr from Pistoia,
to spoil everything.
 
We returned to Prato with heavy hearts,
and I took up my study of the abandoned Illiad,
quiet and discouraged.
 
Thursday morning the rumor began to spread
that the following Sunday,
if the weather was favorable,
Manissero would attempt to fly
from Florence to Prato and back:
thirty kilometers round trip!
 
By Saturday, Via Magnolfi, the Corso,
Via del&#39;Oche, Via Firenzuola—all the streets of Prato
were crisscrossed with white banners
carrying those fateful words:
 
Today We Fly.
 
By noon Sunday
rivers of people from the surrounding the countryside
were flooding into the city through its five gates,
and by three o&#39;clock
the cathedral square was awash
with a restless and noisy crowd,
pale, perspiring, noses in the air.
I stood among them with my classmates,
all of us impatient, barely kept in check
by the stern gaze of our principal
and the softer reprimands of the teachers.
 
We began to hear a new word:
Velivolo!
dancing above the buzz of the crowd.
But that name for aeroplane, recently coined by d&#39;Annunzio,
seemed too delicate for the gaping mouths of dumbstruck farmers:
it was still fresh, still smelled of varnish,
and was as sweet and sharp in the mouth
as mint candy.
Velivolo!
 
Suddenly a white wing appeared in the blue sky
and the reed-and-paper bird
grew larger, came closer,
hovered over the cathedral square.
 
A cry, only one, but from a thousand throats;
a cry more of fear than joy:
then sudden silence,
bursting with anguish.
Manissero was perhaps two hundred meters above our heads,
and it seemed miraculous.
Miraculous not just because he was flying,
but because he was flying over Prato,
in the virgin sky of Prato!
which only the kites of children had dared to caress
until today.
 
As long as the flying was over Florence,
things were fine:
certain facts, in Florence, are understandable,
are legitimate, and fit within in the logic of history.
 
But over Prato!
Over Prato where for centuries now
nothing miraculous had happened.
Not on the ground,
and not in the sky.
Especially not in the sky.
 
Over Prato!
Where it seemed that miracles had become impossible,
caught as we were
between the historic pride of Florence
and the ancient jealousy of Pistoia.
Sacrificed,
reduced to poor relations,
robbed not only of everything that we had,
which would have been bad enough,
but of everything we might have wanted to have.
 
Yet here was Manissero flying in our sky,
in the neglected sky of Prato.
And he was flying, or so it seemed,
better than he might have flown in the sky of Florence.
Better than in any other sky in Tuscany!
 
After a moment, though, the suspicion began to grow
that he might fly as far as Pistoia.
Everyone held their breath,
balanced on one foot,
hearts stopped between beats:
 
The treacherous sky of Pistoia!
 
Some us took out our keys,
ready to rattle them against such a betrayal.
The rest of us set our lips
to whistle in defiance.
But Manissero veered to the right,
and after a wide turn over Prato
he headed back toward Florence.
 
The city detonated with joy.
I lost myself in the crowd, beyond thought,
proud citizen of Prato to my bones.
It wouldn&#39;t be too much to say that all of us, that day,
felt we held a piece of sky in our hands.
 
That night, in my dreams, the Achaean army,
assembling beneath the walls of Troy,
came to a halt, astonished at what lay before them:
stretching from tower to tower
immense white banners
on which great red letters spelled out:
Today We Fly.
 
And then Troy, the city of Priam—
which from a distance resembled nothing more than Prato—
detached itself gently from the earth,
hovered with its banners snapping in the breeze,
and drifted away into the clear sky,
swinging gently from side to side.
 
Maddened Achilles ran along below, commanding:
Stop! Stop!
 
And from the buzz of his accent
you might have thought he was from Pistoia.
 
Beloved Priam, from the top of the Trojan gates.
answered sweetly:
Too Late. Too Late.
 
And his voice had all soft accents of Prato,
taking flight.</poem_text>

		<title>Xian of Eight Rivers</title>
		<poem_text>China is made of earth, of sun-dried mud.
 
In this part of China everything is made from the earth:
the houses, the walls around cities, and villages,
the tombs scattered over the countryside.
Even the people.
 
There are hills below that appear to be piles of mud
set out to dry in the sun, naked,
without a single tree or bush.
They crowd around the landscape
like the coils of bulging intestines
tossed on the ground outside butchers&#39; shops,
slowly unraveling.
 
Sometimes we fly so low that we almost touch them.
 
And then I notice that the wind has brushed
some kind of pattern into the earth: a mysterious alphabet
written in the mud,
struggling to communicate something precise.
But there is not a single animal
or human being in the yellow desert below.
 
Not a single village.
  
 Suddenly we are landing: Xian,
 the geographic center of China,
 where Chinese civilization was born,
 in the cradle of the Yellow River.
  
 In front of the terminal,
 three children are playing with a lump of earth:
 they are bundled up in jackets
 and brightly printed cotton trousers.
 I join them in their game
 until a young woman comes out of the terminal
 to call me in for dinner.
 One of the children grabs me by my overcoat,
 to keep me from leaving.
 So do the other two, clinging to me,
 asking me not to go.
  
 The young woman comes out again,
 and yells at them to stop.
  
 They let go, disappointed.
 One of them calls to me as I turn away:
 Come back soon!
  
 We eat quickly and then prepare to take off for Lanchow.
 My three new friends wave goodbye to me. The littlest one
 gives me a present: a pebble,
 a precious gift.
 In this part of China there are no stones.
 You have to go to Karelia to find stone,
 very far north; or to the Caucasus;
 or to southern Siberia, along the slopes of the Pamir,
 slanting toward the steppes of Central Asia.
  
 I put the pebble in my pocket,
 to take back home, to show what a precious gift
 I was given by a little Chinese girl: a pebble
 from the cradle of Chinese civilization.
  
 A civilization made of earth,
 a civilization without bones,
 without a skeleton for support.
 A civilization of assembled customs,
 which suddenly unravel,
 dissolving into thousands of separate gestures,
 thousands of calligraphic icons,
 thousands of smells, colors, flavors,
 thousands of different shades. And then just as suddenly
 they solidify again into tradition, memory, habit.
  
 It is this absence of stone, of solid, durable material,
 which makes China such an exquisite thing.
 Everything is reflected:
 an unimaginable number of movements,
 of patterns, thoughts, images,
 of which we see the copies in immense numbers,
 but never the originals.
  
 The originals were destroyed long ago.
  
 Here are the four elements out of which China is made:
 Earth, Wood, Porcelain, Silk.
 The most durable of these is Silk.
  
 I should add a fifth element: Poetry,
 which is the most durable of all.</poem_text>

A pretty price if you would sell— 
All fleet of foot, and swift to scent, 
Inexorable once on the track, 
Like angry words you might have meant, 
But do not mean, and can’t take back.

How they would bay and rend apart 
The hopeless belling from a stag. 
You falter now for the foundered hart. 
Desires you nursed of a winter night—

					We’re here for the time being, I answer to the query—

We’ve taped the broken window pane. tv’s still out of whack.
We’re here for the time being, I answer to the query.
When we crossed the water, we only brought what we could carry,
But there are always boxes that you never do unpack.
Nothing is more permanent than the temporary.
Sometimes when I’m feeling weepy, you propose a theory:
Nostalgia and tear gas have the same acrid smack.
We’re here for the time being, I answer to the query—
We stash bones in the closet when we don’t have time to bury,
Stuff receipts in envelopes, file papers in a stack.
Nothing is more permanent than the temporary.
Twelve years now and we’re still eating off the ordinary:
We left our wedding china behind, afraid that it might crack.
We’re here for the time being, we answer to the query,
But nothing is more permanent than the temporary.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>The land is full of what was lost. What&#39;s hidden

In new-ploughed fields, and fields stubbled again: 
The clay shards, foot and lip, that heaped the midden, 
And here and there a blade or flakes of blade, 
A patient art, knapped from a core of flint, 
Most broken, few as coins new from the mint, 
Perfect, shot through time as through a glade. 
You cannot help but think how they were lost: 
The quarry, fletched shaft in its flank, the blood 
Whose trail soon vanished in the antlered wood, 
Not just the meat, but what the weapon cost— 
O hapless hunter, though your aim was true— 
The wounded hart, spooked, fleeting in its fear— 
And the sharpness honed with longing, year by year 
Buried deeper, found someday, but not by you.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>For Rachel
					Right shoulder aching with day-long butchery,
Left shoulder numb with dints clanged on the shield,
The hero is fouled with blood, his own and others’,
First slick, then sticky, then caked, starting to mat
His beard—the armor deadweight all around him;
His teeth grit and rattle with every jolt
Of bronze-rimmed wheels behind the shit-flecked horses.
But when he glimpses the mountains, the distant snow,
A blankness swoons upon him, and he hears
Nothing but the white vowels of the wind
Brushing through stands of spears like conifers
While a banner slips its staff and hangs in the blue
Like a kestrel or a contrail. The hero’s death,
The prize, elusive quarry of his life,
Stands stock-still in her cloven tracks in snow
And turns, one ear tuned to the creek’s far bank,
One dished towards him. Her unstartled gaze
Beads on him like a sniper’s sights, until
At the clean report of a cracking poplar branch,
She leaps away like luck, over rapid water,
And snowfall scrims the scene like a mist of tears,
Like a migraine, like sweat or blood streaming into your eyes.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Every night, we couldn’t sleep. 
Our upstairs neighbors had to keep 
Dropping something down the hall— 
A barbell or a bowling ball, 
And from the window by the bed, 
Echoing inside my head, 
Alley cats expended breath 
In arias of love and death. 
Dawn again, across the street, 
Jackhammers began to beat 
Like hangovers, and you would frown— 
That well-built house, why tear it down? 
Noon, the radiator grill 
Groaned, gave off a lesser chill 
So that we could take off our coats. 
The pipes coughed to clear their throats. 
Our nerves were frayed like ravelled sleeves, 
We cherished each our minor griefs 
To keep them warm until the night, 
When it was time again to fight; 
But we were young, did not need much

		<title>Sestina: Like</title>
		<poem_text>With a nod to Jonah Winter
					Now we’re all “friends,” there is no love but Like,
 A semi-demi goddess, something like
 A reality-TV star look-alike,
 Named Simile or Me Two. So we like
 In order to be liked. It isn’t like
 There’s Love or Hate now. Even plain “dislike”
 Is frowned on: there’s no button for it. Like
 Is something you can quantify: each “like”
 You gather’s almost something money-like,
 Token of virtual support. “Please like
 This page to stamp out hunger.” And you’d like
 To end hunger and climate change alike,
 But it’s unlikely Like does diddly. Like
 Just twiddles its unopposing thumbs-ups, like-
 Wise props up scarecrow silences. “I’m like,
 So OVER him,” I overhear. “But, like,
 He doesn’t get it. Like, you know? He’s like
 It’s all OK. Like I don’t even LIKE
 Him anymore. Whatever. I’m all like ... ”
 Take “like” out of our chat, we’d all alike
 Flounder, agape, gesticulating like
 A foreign film sans subtitles, fall like
 Dumb phones to mooted desuetude. Unlike
 With other crutches, um, when we use “like,”
 We’re not just buying time on credit: Like
 Displaces other words; crowds, cuckoo-like,
 Endangered hatchlings from the nest. (Click “like”
 If you’re against extinction!) Like is like
 Invasive zebra mussels, or it’s like
 Those nutria-things, or kudzu, or belike
 Redundant fast food franchises, each like
 (More like) the next. Those poets who dislike
 Inversions, archaisms, who just like
 Plain English as she’s spoke — why isn’t “like”
 Their (literally) every other word? I’d like
 Us just to admit that’s what real speech is like.
 But as you like, my friend. Yes, we’re alike,
 How we pronounce, say, lichen, and dislike
 Cancer and war. So like this page. Click Like.</poem_text>

		<title>Sublunary</title>
		<poem_text>Mid-sentence, we remembered the eclipse, 
Arguing home through our scant patch of park 
Still warm with barrel wine, when none too soon 
We checked the hour by glancing at the moon, 
Unphased at first by that old ruined marble 
Looming like a monument over the hill, 
So brimmed with light it seemed about to spill, 
Then, there! We watched the thin edge disappear— 
The obvious stole over us like awe, 
That it was our own silhouette we saw, 
Slow perhaps to us moon-gazing here 
(Reaching for each other&#39;s fingertips) 
But sweeping like a wing across that stark 
Alien surface at the speed of dark. 
The crickets stirred from winter sleep to warble 
Something out of time, confused and brief, 
The roosting birds sang out in disbelief, 
The neighborhood&#39;s stray dogs began to bark. 
And then the moon was gone, and in its place, 
A dim red planet hung just out of reach, 
As real as a bitter orange or ripened peach 
In the penumbra of a tree. At last 
We rose and strolled at a reflective pace 
Past the taverna crammed with light and smoke 
And people drinking, laughing at a joke, 
Unaware that anything had passed 
Outside in the night where we delayed 
Sheltering in the shadow we had made.</poem_text>

		<title>The Catch</title>
		<poem_text>Something has come between us— 
It will not sleep. 
Every night it rises like a fish 
Out of the deep. 
It cries with a human voice, 
It aches to be fed. 
Every night we heave it weeping 
Into our bed, 
With its heavy head lolled back, 
Its limbs hanging down, 
Like a mer-creature fetched up 
From the weeds of the drowned. 
Damp in the tidal dark, it whimpers, 
Tossing the cover,   
Separating husband from wife, 
Lover from lover. 
It settles in the interstice, 
It spreads out its arms, 
While its cool underwater face 
Sharpens and warms: 
This is the third thing that makes 
Father and mother, 
The fierce love of our fashioning 
That will have no brother.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>I hate you,
How the children plead
At ?rst sight—
I want, I need,
I hate how nearly 
Always I
At ?rst say no,
And then comply.
(Soon, soon
They will grow bored
Clutching your 
Umbilical cord)—
Over the moon,
Lighter-than-air,
Should you come home,
They’d cease to care—
Who tugs you through
The front door
On a leash, won’t want you
Anymore
And will forget you
On the ceiling—
Admittedly,
A giddy feeling—
Later to ?nd you,
Puckered, small,
Crouching low
Against the wall.
O thin-of-skin
And ?t to burst,
You break for her
Who wants you worst.
Your forebear was
The sack of the winds,
The boon that gives
And then rescinds,
Containing nothing
But the force
That blows everyone
Off course.
Once possessed,
Your one chore done,
You ?oat like happiness
To the sun,
Untethered afternoon,
Unkind,
Marooning all
You’ve left behind:
Their tinfoil tears,
Their plastic cries,
Their wheedling
And moot goodbyes,
You shrug them off—
You do not heed—
O loose bloom
             With no root
                              No seed.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Blacksmithing demonstration, mountain arts and crafts fair, Monteagle, TN
					“But can you forge a nail?” the blond boy asks,
And the blacksmith shoves a length of ?iron rod
Deep in the coal fire cherished by the bellows
Until it glows volcanic. He was a god
Before anachronism, before the tasks
That had been craft were jobbed out to machine.
By dint of?? hammer-song he makes his keen,
Raw point, and crowns utility with rose:
Quincunx of facets petaling its head.
The breeze-made-visible sidewinds. The boy’s
Blonde mother shifts and coughs. Once Work was wed
To Loveliness?—?sweat-faced, swarthy from soot, he
Reminds us with the old saw he employs
(And doesn’t miss a beat): “Smoke follows beauty.”</poem_text>

Something about the way they drop

As if to catch the last applause,
And drink the moment through long straws,
And how, tomorrow, they’ll be missed.
The way they’re somehow getting clearer,
The tulips make me want to see—

Glance now over the wrong shoulder
To watch them get a little older
And give themselves up to the light.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>One was fire red,   
Hand carved and new— 
The local maker pried the wood 
From a torn-down church&#39;s pew, 
The Devil&#39;s instrument 
Wrenched from the house of God. 
It answered merrily and clear 
Though my fingering was flawed; 
Bright and sharp as a young wine, 
They said, but it would mellow, 
And that I would grow into it. 
The other one was yellow 
And nicked down at the chin, 
A varnish of Baltic amber, 
A one-piece back of tiger maple 
And a low, dark timbre. 
A century old, they said, 
Its sound will never change. 
Rich and deep on G and D, 
Thin on the upper range, 
And how it came from the Old World 
Was anybody&#39;s guess— 
Light as an exile&#39;s suitcase, 
A belly of emptiness: 
That was the one I chose 
(Not the one of flame)   
And teachers would turn in their practiced hands 
To see whence the sad notes came.</poem_text>

		<title>Written on the eve of my 20th high school reunion, which I was not able to attend</title>
		<poem_text>For the Briarcliff High School class of 1986
					Just what I needed, 
Just when the dreams had almost totally receded, 
The dreams of roles for which I learned no lines and knew no cues, 
Dreams of pop quizzes with no pants on and no shoes, 
Just when I understood I was no longer among 
Those ephemeral immortals, the gauche and pitiable young, 
Suddenly come phone calls, messages sift out of the air 
To ask who will be there: 
Names I haven&#39;t given a thought to in a score 
(A score!) of years, and names I used to think about but don&#39;t much anymore, 
And those I think of all the time and yet 
Have lost somehow like keys to doors I&#39;ve closed, and some I have tried to forget— 
And some who will never arrive at this date 
Here in the distant future where we wait 
Still surprised at how 
We carry with us the omnipresent and ever-changing now. 
We wince at what we used to wear, 
Fashion has made ridiculous the high hubris of our hair. 
Heartbreak, looked at through the wrong end of distance&#39;s glasses, 
Is trivial, and quickly passes, 
Its purity embarrasses us, its lust, 
The way we wept because it was unjust. 
Why should we travel back, who&#39;ve come so far— 
We know who we are. 
How can we be the same 
As those quaint ancestors we have left behind, who share our name— 
Why have we inherited their shame?</poem_text>

		<title>A Pornography</title>
		<poem_text>There was a time when I watched it happen.
 Strangers pressed to other strangers
 in one bed, clothes on, air humid
 with the cloying scent of fruit juice
 and vodka; none of us
 giving into another and yet unwilling to leave the scene
 of that possibility,
 pretending to sleep, actually sleeping.
 Then waking again to slip a hand
 over a shoulder, slide a finger
 inside the waistband of a skirt; so young
 (we are even now still
 so young) in that hotel room
 turning blue then lighter blue.
 We wouldn’t have tried for more:
 the kiss, the button; firm, white shape
 of an image slipped wholly into the mind,
 acted upon, dreamed upon,
 filling the thin vessels of the lungs.
  
 Earlier, a film, its forced sounds
 of lovemaking. The tension I felt winding
 into the muscles of some of the others in the room.
 I remember I left for awhile.
 We all left for awhile;
 even the music was frightening. How
 to strip ourselves like that, point
 at the places that were wanted, plucked
 and peeled; speaking the words, hearing them form us,
 the nature of what we were
 and could do to each other?
 The music, the rocking, the sobbing.
 The man called the woman by parts of herself.
 Some laughed at this. I remember
 I must have been one of them.
 In the morning, the hotel room was turning white.
 After the long night, hands were slipping
 and unslipping, moving over the flattened pillows
 as if in hopes something small could still satisfy us.
 Someone turned and looked at someone else;
 we all heard it. Legs
 shifted, sheets slid themselves down waists
 or shoulders, tightened again at the necks
 of those pretending to sleep as the unblinking sun
 crawled in our window.
 From another room, coughing,
 We all heard it.
 Someone looked at someone else.
 The room turned white. The air began clearing.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>I’m here, one fat cherry
               blossom blooming like a clod,
  
 one sad groat glazing, a needle puling thread,
               so what, so sue me. These days what else to do but leer
  
 at any boy with just the right hairline. Hey! I say,
               That’s one tasty piece of nature. Tart Darkling,
  
 if I could I’d gin, I’d bargain, I’d take a little troll
               this moolit night, let you radish me awhile,
  
 let you gag and confound me. How much I’ve struggled
               with despicing you, always; your false poppets, relentless
  
 distances. Yet plea-bargaining and lack of conversation
               continue to make me
  
 your faithful indefile. I’m lonely. I’ve turned
               all rage to rag, all pratfalls fast to fatfalls for you,
  
 My Farmer in the Dwell. So struggle, strife,
               so strew me, to bell with these clucking mediocrities,
  
 these anxieties over such beings thirty, still smitten
               with this heaven never meant for, never heard from.
  
 You’ve said we’re each pockmarked like a golf course
               with what can’t be said of us, bred in us,
  
 isn’t our tasty piece of nature. But I tell you
               I’ve stars, I’ve true blue depths, have learned to use
  
 the loo, the crew, the whole slough of pill-popping
               devices without you, your intelligent and pitiless graze.
  
 Everyone knows love is just a euphemism
               for you’ve failed me anyway. So screw me.
  
 Bartering Yam, regardless of want I’m nothing
               without scope, hope, nothing
  
 without your possibility. So let’s laugh
               like the thieves we are together, the sieves:
  
 you, my janus gate, my Sigmund Fraud,
               my crawling, crack-crazed street sprawled out,
  
 revisible, spell-bound.
               Hello, joy. I’m thirsty. I’m Pasty Rectum.
  
 In your absence I’ve learned to fill myself
               with starts. Here’s my paters. Here’s my blue.
  
 I just wanted to write again and say
               how much I’ve failed you.</poem_text>

		<title>Flowers from a New Love after the Divorce</title>
		<poem_text>Cut back the stems an inch to keep in bloom.
So instructs the florist’s note
enclosed inside the flowers.
Who knew what was cut
could heal again, the green wounds close,
stitching themselves together?
It doesn’t matter. The flowers, red
and white, will bloom awhile, then wither.
You sit in an unlit room and watch
the vase throw crystal shadows through the dark.
The flowers’ colors are so lovely they’re painful.
In a week, you’ll have to throw them out.
It’s only hope that makes you take out scissors,
separate each bloom and cut
where you last measured. Did you know
Venus was said to turn into a virgin
each time she bathed? She did it
as a mark of love. She did it
so as to please her lovers. Perhaps,
overwhelmed by pain,
she eventually stopped bathing
altogether. It doesn’t matter. It’s a pleasure
to feel the green nubs stripped, watch the stems
refresh under your blade. They’re here
because they’re beautiful. They glow
inside your crystal vase. And yet
the flowers by themselves are nothing:
only a refraction of color that,
in a week or two, will be thrown out.
Day by day, the water lowers. The red-
and-white heads droop, blacken at the stems. 
It doesn’t matter. Even cut stems heal. 
But what is the point of pain if it heals? 
Some things should last forever, instructs 
the florist’s note. Pleasure, 
says one god. Shame, says another.
Venus heads, they call these flowers. 
In a week or two, you’ll lose the note, 
have to call the florist up. 
With sympathy, you’ll think he says. 
Perhaps: With love. It doesn’t matter. 
You’ve stopped bathing. Alone,
you sit before the crystal
vase refracting you in pieces
through the dark. You watch
the pale skin bloom inside it, wither.
You petal, inch by inch.
You turn red and white together.</poem_text>

		<title>Happiness</title>
		<poem_text>I have been taught never to brag but now
I cannot help it: I keep
a beautiful garden, all abundance,
indiscriminate, pulling itself
from the stubborn earth: does it offend you
to watch me working in it,
touching my hands to the greening tips or
tearing the yellow stalks back, so wild
the living and the dead both
snap off in my hands?
The neighbor with his stuttering
fingers, the neighbor with his broken
love: each comes up my drive
to receive his pitying,
accustomed consolations, watches me
work in silence awhile, rises in anger,
walks back. Does it offend them to watch me
not mourning with them but working
fitfully, fruitlessly, working
the way the bees work, which is to say
by instinct alone, which looks like pleasure?
I can stand for hours among the sweet
narcissus, silent as a point of bone.
I can wait longer than sadness. I can wait longer
than your grief. It is such a small thing
to be proud of, a garden. Today
there were scrub jays, quail,
a woodpecker knocking at the white-
and-black shapes of trees, and someone’s lost rabbit
scratching under the barberry: is it
indiscriminate? Should it shrink back, wither,
and expurgate? Should I, too, not be loved?
It is only a little time, a little space.
Why not watch the grasses take up their colors in a rush
like a stream of kerosene being lit?
If I could not have made this garden beautiful
I wouldn’t understand your suffering,
nor care for each the same, inflamed way.
I would have to stay only like the bees,
beyond consciousness, beyond
self-reproach, fingers dug down hard
into stone, and growing nothing.
There is no end to ego,
with its museum of disappointments.
I want to take my neighbors into the garden
and show them: Here is consolation.
Here is your pity. Look how much seed it drops
around the sparrows as they fight.
It lives alongside their misery.
It glows each evening with a violent light.</poem_text>

		<title>Ode</title>
		<poem_text>And now the silver, ripping sound of white on white, the satin,
 light snow torn
 under wheels, car bang metally grenading, and the wood poles,
 whipping, loom—
  

                                     ¤
 
 I have always wanted to sing a song of praise
  
 for the unscathed: myself
 stepping from the fractured car whose black axle’s one inch
 from gone; slim pole slicing cable
  
 up to sheet metal, seat foam, corduroy
 (like butter, the mechanic will later
 tell me, poking a stiff finger through the cloth),
 to pierce the exact point
  
 I was supposed to sit, stopping
 because praise begins where pain
 transfigures itself,
 stoppered by a deeper kind of joy: so I
 transfigure myself from driver
  
 to survivor, the blessed Lazarine failure
  
 bolting up and opening her eyes.
 And here are the thousand wrecks
 from a life configured in snow before me: myself,
 at five, pulled from the burning car seat;
 at twelve, bleeding from the scalp
 after the car throws me from my bike; at fourteen,
 tumbling over the slick hood rushing;
 sockets of windows with glass
 bashed out into a translucent, toothy ring; lights
 and bumpers clipped clean off; tires burst; deer
 gravitationally hurled through my windshield; brakes
 given out and worse,
  
 the icy loop de loops
 on roads, the trucker’s 18 fat wheels squealing—
 All the ways technology should have killed me
  
 and didn’t.
 Praise for my death-hungry luck!
 And all the manner in which I’ve failed it—
 marriage lost,
  
 buried in the blanks of white space, my solitude
 at the Greyhound station
 knowing no one to retrieve me,
 carless among the other pressed tight
 to their own disaster or boredom—
 unbearably young mothers,
  
 drifters, boy soldiers
 shoulder to shoulder with the insane, weaving
 the same thread of conversation back and forth
 between ourselves. How
  
 could this happen to me
 at this age, at this stage, how
 did I not notice, and will you put this seat up?
 and will you lend me this quarter? and will you 
 call me a cab when we get back home?
  
 The young man in the seat before me, head
 full of zigzagging tight braids says,
  
 Sure you can dig up that ballot box in Florida
 and while you’re at it look up all the bones
 buried in the Everglades, repeats it
  
 for the amusement of the woman across from him,
 who knows a presidential failure like she knows herself,
 and when we pass my accident on the road points
 and whistles, snickers:  Bet you no one walked away from that one.
  
 For this, and for all these things: praise
  
 to the white plains of Wyoming, highway coiled
 like a length of rime-colored rope; to snow
 broiling in the sunlight so that the landscape
 takes on a nuclear glow, so bright
  
 we have to shield our eyes from it. Praise
 for myself playing at morbidity
 because I thought I had a right to it
  
 as if flesh had to follow spirit
 to such a pure depth the bones themselves
 could not rest but must be broken, nerves
 singed then ripped out, the heart clenched madly in its chest.
  
 As if I had nothing except this white earth, this
 smashed car to praise
  
 what I knew before and know 
 even better now, the hills
 cold as a hip bone and tufted with ice. Praise
 to my youth and to my age, praise
  
 to ambition and small-mindedness,
 the kind I recognize and the kind
 I am soon to recognize; praise
  
 to self-hatred for it keeps me alive, and praise
 for the splinters of delight that can pierce it.
 Praise for wood pole, praise for glass.
 Praise for muscle, praise for bone.
  
 The sky is bright as a bowl on a nurse’s table today.
  
 And the sun gleams into it as our bus slides by,
 the light of us a wash of gold illuminating
 bodies lost, bodies regained; gleaming
  
 like my heart here, on this earth,
 bloody and still beating.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Yesterday, everything was possible. Today we’re good
 as married. You don’t want to hear that,
 do you, thinking I’m going to call you back
 in from the rain to fight over the morning paper,
 limning my deft and emotional promiscuities?
 That we’ll sit in our sitting room,
 watching the shaggy junipers twirl in winter wind
 as a storm closes its throat around the city?
 I’m thinking about how to ask God to be nicer.
 I’m thinking about that fabled leper colony
 where the last, solitary patient waited inside its unlocked tower
 three years in the belief she could not step outside.
 And how the local doctors visited only
 to re-wrap her face, to brush out her last gold strands
 of hair, wondering how to save anybody
 so willing to kill herself with denial.
 They wanted to talk about pain, the doctors, to say,
 One day, you’ll be half asleep in the dark, listening to a radio
 play in another room, and feel yourself
 suddenly filling like a jug with the cold
 awareness nothing more will ever happen, the disaster
 of your old ambivalence, the familiarity
 of desire’s wolfish teeth sinking into the body.
 The body, as if it didn’t belong to you anymore.
 The doctors said, Fear should never be elevated
 to ritual. They told the woman, You must change your life!
 One day, I’m on the steps of an office tower losing a shoe,
 the next I’m screaming on a gurney, I’m stuffing a baby
 into a diaper. I’m wondering the woods
 in my scar-dark cape. Every story has an archetype, doesn’t it?
 And if so, why aren’t we married? Why can’t we be
 just like everyone else this fucking, fucking once? God, I hate
 the way this tale is turning out: two aged strangers learning
 to tuck in their blood, hiding the knives and bread crumbs
 deep inside their pockets. Look, this time I swear,
 I won’t run; really; I’ll come and go from my stone room
 without a mirror, all my extremities taped in white.
 I’ll learn to knit with three fingers. I’ll learn to read
 into the deepening silences, to be nice to your step-sisters,
 singing to drown out the tears of their ugliness.
 I love you. Can I even say that? In this story,
 I want to spend the rest of my life growing quietly bored with you,
 locking away loom and spindle, sweeping out the piles
 of rose petals and ash. For once, I plan to triumph
 over smug experience. I marry you. Don’t hit me.
 Please, just come in from the stars awhile, sit here
 in this sitting room, let me find you another section of the paper
 to argue over. The doctors said I get to wear a suit.
 They said I’ll be released next Thursday. Listen:
 even now, the junipers are whispering their dark good-byes,
 thin limbs smocked in white. A riderless horse has appeared
 on the horizon. And somewhere, out in the meretricious night,
 somebody’s life is quietly changing.</poem_text>

tissues plumped then promptly deflated.
 
What else am I supposed to start with?
 
Not the light bulb, to which
this whole narrative yearns, loving
the glass envelope sizzling with light,
grasshopper antennae scrubbed

No, I have to start with the arm first, the mint-blue
lamp, then maybe light itself to specify
what startles me
 
about you, globe of hot fruit, Christ heart
throbbing in the open chest; curtains of robe parted
just enough to see what afterglow defines us, waits for us,
rubbing its slow music out into the wet dark—
 
Tonight, I’m counting out my seeds of waiting for you
 
through a current that is silent

I carefully adjust

		<poem_text>And then I thought, Can I have more
of this, would it be possible
for every day to be a greater awakening: more light,
more light, your face on the pillow
with the sleep creases rudely
fragmenting it, hair so stiff
from paint and sheet rock it feels
like the dirty short hank
of mane I used to grab on Dandy’s neck
before he hauled me up and forward,
white flanks flecked green
with shit and the satin of his dander,
the livingness, the warmth
of all that blood just under the skin
and in the long, thick muscle of the neck—
He was smarter than most of the children
I went to school with. He knew
how to stand with just the crescent
of his hoof along a boot toe and press,
incrementally, his whole weight down. The pain
so surprising when it came,
its iron intention sheathed in stealth, the decisive
sudden twisting of his leg until the hoof
pinned one’s foot completely to the ground,
we’d have to beat and beat him with a brush
to push him off, that hot
insistence with its large horse eye trained
deliberately on us, to watch—
Like us, he knew how to announce through violence
how he didn’t hunger, didn’t want
despite our practiced ministrations: too young
not to try to empathize
with this cunning: this thing
that was and was not human we must respect
for itself and not our imagination of it: I loved him because
I could not love him anymore
in the ways I’d taught myself,
watching the slim bodies of teenagers
guide their geldings in figure eights around the ring
as if they were one body, one fluid motion
of electric understanding I would never feel
working its way through fingers to the bit: this thing
had a name, a need, a personality; it possessed
an indifference that gave me
logic and a measure: I too might stop wanting
the hand placed on back or shoulder
and never feel the desired response.
I loved the horse for the pain it could imagine
and inflict on me, the sudden jerking
of head away from halter, the tentative nose
inspecting first before it might decide
to relent and eat. I loved
what was not slave or instinct, that when you turn to me
it is a choice, it is always a choice to imagine pleasure
might be blended, one warmth
bleeding into another as the future
bleeds into the past, more light, more light,
your hand against my shoulder, the image
of the one who taught me disobedience
is the first right of being alive.</poem_text>

		<title>Abandoned Ranch, Big Bend</title>
		<poem_text>Three people come where no people belong any more.   
They are a woman who would be young 
And good-looking if these now seemed 
Real qualities, a child with yellow hair, a man   
Hardened in desperate humanity. But here are only   
Dry cistern, adobe flaking, a lizard. And now this   
Disagreeable feeling that they were summoned. Sun   
On the corrugated roof is a horse treading, 
A horse with wide wings and heavy hoofs. The lizard   
Is splayed head down on the wall, pulsing. They do not   
Bother to lift their binoculars to the shimmering distance.   
From this dead center the desert spirals away,   
Traveling outward and inward, pulsing. Summoned   
From half across the world, from snow and rock,   
From chaos, they arrived a moment ago, they thought,   
In perfect fortuity. There is a presence emerging here in   
Sun dance and clicking metal, where the lizard blinks   
With eyes whetted for extinction; then swirling   
Outward again, outward and upward through the sky&#39;s   
White-hot funnel. Again and again among the dry   
Wailing voices of displaced Yankee ghosts 
This ranch is abandoned to terror and the sublime.   
The man turns to the woman and child. He has never   
Said what he meant. They give him 
The steady cool mercy of their unreproachful eyes.</poem_text>

		<title>Bears at Raspberry Time</title>
		<poem_text>Fear. Three bears 
are not fear, mother 
and cubs come berrying   
in our neighborhood 
like any other family. 
I want to see them, or any   
distraction. Flashlight   
poking across the brook 
into briary darkness,   
but they have gone, 
noisily. I go to bed.   
Fear. Unwritten books 
already titled. Some 
idiot will shoot the bears 
soon, it always happens, 
they’ll be strung up by the paws 
in someone’s frontyard   
maple to be admired and   
measured, and I&#39;ll be paid   
for work yet to be done— 
with a broken imagination.   
At last I dream. Our 
plum tree, little, black,   
twisted, gaunt in the 
orchard: how for a moment   
last spring it flowered 
serenely, translucently 
before yielding its usual 
summer crop of withered   
leaves. I waken, late,   
go to the window, look   
down to the orchard. 
Is middle age what makes   
even dreams factual? 
The plum is serene and   
bright in new moonlight, 
dressed in silver leaves, 
and nearby, in the waste 
of rough grass strewn 
in moonlight like diamond dust, 
what is it?—a dark shape   
moves, and then another.   
Are they ... I can’t 
be sure. The dark house 
nuzzles my knee mutely,   
pleading for meaty dollars.   
Fear. Wouldn’t it be great   
to write nothing at all 
except poems about bears?</poem_text>

		<title>Nabokov’s Blues</title>
		<poem_text>The wallful of quoted passages from his work,   
with the requisite specimens pinned next 
to their literary cameo appearances, was too good 
a temptation to resist, and if the curator couldn’t,   
why should we? The prose dipped and shimmered   
and the “flies,” as I heard a buff call them, stood 
at lurid attention on their pins. If you love to read   
and look, you could be happy a month in that small   
room. One of the Nabokov photos I’d never seen: 
he’s writing (left-handed! why did I never trouble   
to find out?) at his stand-up desk in the hotel   
apartment in Montreux. The picture’s mostly 
of his back and the small wedge of face that shows   
brims with indifference to anything not on the page.   
The window’s shut. A tiny lamp trails a veil of light 
over the page, too far away for us to read.   
We also liked the chest of specimen drawers   
labeled, as if for apprentice Freudians, 
“Genitalia,” wherein languished in phials 
the thousands he examined for his monograph   
on the Lycaenidae, the silver-studded Blues. 
And there in the center of the room a carillon 
of Blues rang mutely out. There must have been 
three hundred of them. Amanda’s Blue was there, 
and the Chalk Hill Blue, the Karner Blue 
(Lycaeides melissa samuelis Nabokov),          
a Violet-Tinged Copper, the Mourning Cloak, 
an Echo Azure, the White-Lined Green Hairstreak, 
the Cretan Argus (known only from Mt. Ida: 
in the series Nabokov did on this beauty 
he noted for each specimen the altitude at which   
it had been taken), and as the ads and lovers say,   
“and much, much more.” The stilled belle of the tower 
was a Lycaeides melissa melissa. No doubt 
it’s an accident Melissa rhymes, sort of, with Lolita,          
The scant hour we could lavish on the Blues 
flew by, and we improvised a path through cars 
and slush and boot-high berms of mud-blurred snow   
to wherever we went next. I must have been mute, 
or whatever I said won from silence nothing   
it mourned to lose. I was back in that small   
room, vast by love of each flickering detail, 
each genital dusting to nothing, the turn,   
like a worm’s or caterpillar’s, of each phrase.   
I stood up to my ankles in sludge pooled 
over a stopped sewer grate and thought—   
wouldn’t you know it—about love and art:   
you can be ruined (“rurnt,” as we said in south- 
western Ohio) by a book or improved by   
a butterfly. You can dodder in the slop, 
septic with a rage not for order but for the love 
the senses bear for what they do, for detail 
that’s never annexed, like a reluctant crumb 
to a vacuum cleaner, to a coherence. 
You can be bead after bead on perception’s rosary. 
This is the sweet ache that hurts most, the way 
desire burns bluely at its phosphorescent core: 
just as you’re having what you wanted most,   
you want it more and more until that’s more   
than you, or it, or both of you, can bear.</poem_text>

To spread at ease under the sky 
In granite-lipped basins,

In the midst of the quiet of close-clipped lawns. 
Damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone,   
Where trickle and plash the fountains,   
Marble fountains, yellowed with much water. 
Splashing down moss-tarnished steps   
It falls, the water; 
And the air is throbbing with it; 
With its gurgling and running; 
With its leaping, and deep, cool murmur. 
And I wished for night and you. 
I wanted to see you in the swimming-pool,   
White and shining in the silver-flecked water. 
While the moon rode over the garden,   
High in the arch of night, 
And the scent of the lilacs was heavy with stillness. 
Night and the water, and you in your whiteness, bathing!</poem_text>

		<title>The Seventh Inning</title>
		<poem_text>1.   Baseball, I warrant, is not the whole   
occupation of the aging boy. 
Far from it: There are cats and roses;   
there is her water body. She fills 
the skin of her legs up, like water;   
under her blouse, water assembles,   
swelling lukewarm; her mouth is water,   
her cheekbones cool water; water flows   
in her rapid hair. I drink water 
2.   from her body as she walks past me   
to open a screen door, as she bends   
to weed among herbs, or as she lies   
beside me at five in the morning   
in submarine light. Curt Davis threw   
a submarine ball, terrifying 
to right-handed batters. Another   
pleasure, thoroughly underrated,   
is micturition, which is even 
3.   commoner than baseball. It begins   
by announcing itself more slowly   
and less urgently than sexual 
desire, but (confusingly) in the 
identical place. Ignorant men 
therefore on occasion confuse beer- 
drinking with love; but I have discussed   
adultery elsewhere. We allow 
this sweet release to commence itself, 
4.   addressing a urinal perhaps,   
perhaps poised over a white toilet   
with feet spread wide and head tilted back:   
oh, what’delicious permission! what   
luxury of letting go! what luxe   
yellow curve of mildest ecstasy!   
Granted we may not compare it to   
poignant and crimson bliss, it is as   
voluptuous as rain all night long 
5.   after baseball in August’s parch. The   
jade plant’s trunk, as thick as a man’s wrist,   
urges upward thrusting from packed dirt,   
with Chinese vigor spreading limbs out   
that bear heavy leaves—palpable, dark,   
juicy, green, profound: They suck, the way   
bleacher fans claim inhabitants of 
box seats do. The Fourth of July we   
exhaust stars from sparklers in the late 
6.   twilight. We swoop ovals of white-gold   
flame, making quick signatures against 
an imploding dark. The five-year-old   
girl kisses the young dog goodbye and   
chases the quick erratic kitten.   
When she returns in a few years as   
a tall shy girl, she will come back to   
a dignified spreading cat and a 
dog ash-gray on the muzzle. Sparklers 
7.   expel quickly this night of farewell:   
If they didn’t burn out, they wouldn’t   
be beautiful. Kurt, may I hazard   
an opinion on expansion? Last 
winter meetings, the major leagues (al- 
ready meager in ability, 
scanty in starting pitchers) voted 
to add two teams. Therefore minor league   
players will advance all too quickly, 
8.   with boys in the bigs who wouldn’t have   
made double-A forty years ago. 
Directors of player personnel 
will search like poets scrambling in old   
notebooks for unused leftover lines, 
but when was the last time anyone 
cut back when he or she could expand?   
Kurt, I get the notion that you were 
another who never discarded 
9.   anything, a keeper from way back.   
You smoked cigarettes, in inflation- 
times rolled from chopped-up banknotes, billions   
inhaled and exhaled as cancerous   
smoke. When commerce woke, Men was awake.   
If you smoked a cigar, the cigar   
band discovered itself glued into   
collage. Ongoing life became the   
material of Kurtschwittersball.</poem_text>

		<title>Advice to a Prophet</title>
		<poem_text>When you come, as you soon must, to the streets of our city,   
Mad-eyed from stating the obvious, 
Not proclaiming our fall but begging us 
In God’s name to have self-pity, 
Spare us all word of the weapons, their force and range,   
The long numbers that rocket the mind; 
Our slow, unreckoning hearts will be left behind,   
Unable to fear what is too strange. 
Nor shall you scare us with talk of the death of the race.   
How should we dream of this place without us?— 
The sun mere fire, the leaves untroubled about us,   
A stone look on the stone’s face? 
Speak of the world’s own change. Though we cannot conceive   
Of an undreamt thing, we know to our cost 
How the dreamt cloud crumbles, the vines are blackened by frost,   
How the view alters. We could believe, 
If you told us so, that the white-tailed deer will slip   
Into perfect shade, grown perfectly shy, 
The lark avoid the reaches of our eye, 
The jack-pine lose its knuckled grip 
On the cold ledge, and every torrent burn 
As Xanthus once, its gliding trout 
Stunned in a twinkling. What should we be without   
The dolphin’s arc, the dove’s return, 
These things in which we have seen ourselves and spoken?   
Ask us, prophet, how we shall call 
Our natures forth when that live tongue is all 
Dispelled, that glass obscured or broken 
In which we have said the rose of our love and the clean   
Horse of our courage, in which beheld 
The singing locust of the soul unshelled, 
And all we mean or wish to mean. 
Ask us, ask us whether with the worldless rose   
Our hearts shall fail us; come demanding   
Whether there shall be lofty or long standing   
When the bronze annals of the oak-tree close.</poem_text>

		<title>Corsons Inlet</title>
		<poem_text>I went for a walk over the dunes again this morning 
to the sea, 
then turned right along 
   the surf 
                         rounded a naked headland 
                         and returned 
   along the inlet shore: 
it was muggy sunny, the wind from the sea steady and high,   
crisp in the running sand, 
       some breakthroughs of sun 
   but after a bit 
continuous overcast: 
the walk liberating, I was released from forms,   
from the perpendiculars, 
      straight lines, blocks, boxes, binds 
of thought 
into the hues, shadings, rises, flowing bends and blends   
               of sight: 
                         I allow myself eddies of meaning:   
yield to a direction of significance 
running 
like a stream through the geography of my work:   
   you can find 
in my sayings 
                         swerves of action 
                         like the inlet’s cutting edge: 
               there are dunes of motion, 
organizations of grass, white sandy paths of remembrance   
in the overall wandering of mirroring mind: 
but Overall is beyond me: is the sum of these events 
I cannot draw, the ledger I cannot keep, the accounting 
beyond the account: 
in nature there are few sharp lines: there are areas of   
primrose 
       more or less dispersed; 
disorderly orders of bayberry; between the rows 
of dunes, 
irregular swamps of reeds, 
though not reeds alone, but grass, bayberry, yarrow, all ... 
predominantly reeds: 
I have reached no conclusions, have erected no boundaries,   
shutting out and shutting in, separating inside 
          from outside: I have 
          drawn no lines: 
          as 
manifold events of sand 
change the dune’s shape that will not be the same shape   
tomorrow, 
so I am willing to go along, to accept   
the becoming 
thought, to stake off no beginnings or ends, establish   
         no walls: 
by transitions the land falls from grassy dunes to creek   
to undercreek: but there are no lines, though 
       change in that transition is clear 
       as any sharpness: but “sharpness” spread out,   
allowed to occur over a wider range 
than mental lines can keep: 
the moon was full last night: today, low tide was low:   
black shoals of mussels exposed to the risk 
of air 
and, earlier, of sun, 
waved in and out with the waterline, waterline inexact,   
caught always in the event of change:   
       a young mottled gull stood free on the shoals 
       and ate 
to vomiting: another gull, squawking possession, cracked a crab,   
picked out the entrails, swallowed the soft-shelled legs, a ruddy 
turnstone running in to snatch leftover bits: 
risk is full: every living thing in 
siege: the demand is life, to keep life: the small 
white blacklegged egret, how beautiful, quietly stalks and spears 
               the shallows, darts to shore 
                            to stab—what? I couldn’t 
       see against the black mudflats—a frightened 
       fiddler crab? 
               the news to my left over the dunes and 
reeds and bayberry clumps was 
               fall: thousands of tree swallows 
               gathering for flight: 
               an order held 
               in constant change: a congregation 
rich with entropy: nevertheless, separable, noticeable 
          as one event, 
                      not chaos: preparations for 
flight from winter, 
cheet, cheet, cheet, cheet, wings rifling the green clumps, 
beaks 
at the bayberries 
    a perception full of wind, flight, curve, 
    sound: 
    the possibility of rule as the sum of rulelessness: 
the “field” of action 
with moving, incalculable center: 
in the smaller view, order tight with shape: 
blue tiny flowers on a leafless weed: carapace of crab: 
snail shell: 
            pulsations of order 
            in the bellies of minnows: orders swallowed,   
broken down, transferred through membranes 
to strengthen larger orders: but in the large view, no 
lines or changeless shapes: the working in and out, together   
            and against, of millions of events: this, 
                         so that I make 
                         no form of 
                         formlessness: 
orders as summaries, as outcomes of actions override   
or in some way result, not predictably (seeing me gain   
the top of a dune, 
the swallows 
could take flight—some other fields of bayberry   
            could enter fall 
            berryless) and there is serenity: 
            no arranged terror: no forcing of image, plan, 
or thought: 
no propaganda, no humbling of reality to precept: 
terror pervades but is not arranged, all possibilities   
of escape open: no route shut, except in   
   the sudden loss of all routes: 
            I see narrow orders, limited tightness, but will   
not run to that easy victory: 
            still around the looser, wider forces work: 
            I will try 
       to fasten into order enlarging grasps of disorder, widening   
scope, but enjoying the freedom that 
Scope eludes my grasp, that there is no finality of vision,   
that I have perceived nothing completely, 
that tomorrow a new walk is a new walk.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>I don’t know somehow it seems sufficient 
to see and hear whatever coming and going is, 
losing the self to the victory 
   of stones and trees, 
of bending sandpit lakes, crescent 
round groves of dwarf pine: 
for it is not so much to know the self   
as to know it as it is known

as if birth had never found it 
and death could never end it: 
the swamp’s slow water comes

holly grows on the banks in the woods there,

green religion in winter bones: 
so I look and reflect, but the air’s glass   
jail seals each thing in its entity: 
no use to make any philosophies here: 
   I see no 
god in the holly, hear no song from

		<title>Light</title>
		<poem_text>Always in the dream I seemed conscious of myself having the dream even as I dreamed it. 
Even now, the dream moving towards light, the field of light flowing gently towards me, 
I watch myself dreaming, I watch myself dreaming and watching, I watch both watchers together. 
It almost seems that this is what dream is about, to think what happens as it’s happening. 
Still, aren’t there disturbing repercussions in being in such an active relation with dream? 
What about nightmare, for instance; nightmare is always lurking there out at the edges, 
it’s part of dream’s definition: how be so involved in the intimate workings of dream 
without being an accomplice of nightmare, a portion of its cause or even its actual cause? 
Doesn’t what comes to me have to be my fault, and wouldn’t the alternative be more troubling still— 
that I might not be the one engendering this havoc, that I’m only allowed to think so, 
that the nightmare itself, hauling me through its vales of anguish, is the operative force? 
What do I mean by nightmare itself, though? Wouldn’t that imply a mind here besides mine? 
But how else explain all the care, first to involve me, then to frighten me out of my wits? 
Mustn’t something with other agendas be shaping the dream; don’t all the enticements and traps 
suggest an intention more baleful than any I’d have for visiting such mayhem on myself? 
And if this isn’t the case, wouldn’t the alternative be as bad; that each element of the dream 
would contain its own entailment so that what came next would just do so for no special reason? 
How frivolous dream would be, then: either way, though, so much subjugation, so little choice. 
Either way, isn’t the real nightmare my having so little power, even over my own consciousness? 
Sometimes, when I arrive in dream here, when I arrive nearly overwhelmed with uncertainty here, 
I feel a compulsion to renounce what so confounds me, to abdicate, surrender, but to what? 
I don’t even know if my despair might not be another deception the devious dream is proposing. 
At last, sometimes, perhaps driven to this, perhaps falling upon it in exhaustion or resignation, 
I try to recapture how I once dreamed, innocently, with no thought of being beside or beyond: 
I imagine myself in that healing accord I still somehow believe must precede or succeed dream. 
My vigilance never flags, though; I behold the infernal beholder, I behold the uncanny beheld, 
this mind streaming through me, its turbulent stillness, its murmur, inexorable, beguiling.</poem_text>

If that someone who’s me yet not me yet who judges me is always with me,    
as he is, shouldn’t he have been there when I said so long ago that thing I said?   
If he who rakes me with such not trivial shame for minor sins now were there then,   
shouldn’t he have warned me he’d even now devastate me for my unpardonable affront?   
I’m a child then, yet already I’ve composed this conscience-beast, who harries me:   
is there anything else I can say with certainty about who I was, except that I, that he,   
could already draw from infinitesimal transgressions complex chords of remorse,   
and orchestrate ever undiminishing retribution from the hapless rest of myself?   
2 
The son of some friends of my parents has died, and my parents, paying their call,   
take me along, and I’m sent out with the dead boy’s brother and some others to play.   
We’re joking around, and some words come to my mind, which to my amazement are said.   
How do you know when you can laugh when somebody dies, your brother dies? 
is what’s said, and the others go quiet, the backyard goes quiet, everyone stares,   
and I want to know now why that someone in me who’s me yet not me let me say it.   
Shouldn’t he have told me the contrition cycle would from then be ever upon me,   
it didn’t matter that I’d really only wanted to know how grief ends, and when?   
3 
I could hear the boy’s mother sobbing inside, then stopping, sobbing then stopping.   
Was the end of her grief already there? Had her someone in her told her it would end?   
Was her someone in her kinder to her, not tearing at her, as mine did, still does, me,   
for guessing grief someday ends? Is that why her sobbing stopped sometimes?   
She didn’t laugh, though, or I never heard her. How do you know when you can laugh? 
Why couldn’t someone have been there in me not just to accuse me, but to explain?   
The kids were playing again, I was playing, I didn’t hear anything more from inside.   
The way now sometimes what’s in me is silent, too, and sometimes, though never really, forgets.   </poem_text>

Bears it about with him in shame; 
Who goes a way I would not go; 
Has knowledge of things I would not know; 
When I was brave he was afraid;   
He told the truth, I lied; 
What’s sweet to me tastes bitter to him; 
My friends, my friends, he doesn’t love them; 
I walk the daylight in his dream; 
He breathes the air of my nightmare.</poem_text>

		<title>Goodnight</title>
		<poem_text>Lying in bed and waiting to find out 
Whatever is going to happen: the window shade 
Making its slightest sound as the night wind,   
Outside, in the night, breathes quietly on it; 
It is parental hovering over the infantile;   
Something like that; it is like being a baby, 
And over the sleep of the baby there is a father, 
Or mother, breathing, hovering; the streetlight light 
In the nighttime branches breathing quietly too;   
Altering; realtering; it is the body breathing; 
The crib of knowing: something about what the day 
Will bring; and something about what the night will hold, 
Safely, at least for the rest of the night, I pray.</poem_text>

In the forests of the night; 
What immortal hand or eye, 
Could frame thy fearful symmetry? 
In what distant deeps or skies. 
Burnt the fire of thine eyes? 
On what wings dare he aspire? 
What the hand, dare seize the fire? 
And what shoulder, &amp; what art, 
Could twist the sinews of thy heart? 
And when thy heart began to beat, 
What dread hand? &amp; what dread feet?

In what furnace was thy brain? 
What the anvil? what dread grasp, 
Dare its deadly terrors clasp!

And water&#39;d heaven with their tears:

Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

Of waters in a land of change. 
He goes to see what suns can make 
From soil more indurateindurate hardened and strange. 
He cuts what holds his days together 
And shuts him in, as lock on lock: 
The arrowed vane announcing weather, 
The tripping rackettripping racket either a paradox: light and easy din, or, light and easy motion (as of a dance)  of a clock; 
Seeking, I think, a light that waits 
Still as a lamp upon a shelf, — 
A land with hills like rocky gates 
Where no sea leaps upon itself. 
But he will find that nothing dares 
To be enduring, save where, south 
Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares 
On beauty with a rusted mouth, — 
Where something dreadful and another 
Look quietly upon each other.</poem_text>

		<title>The Destruction of Sennacherib</title>
		<poem_text>   The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.
   Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,
That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,
That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.
   For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,
And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;
And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,
And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!
   And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,
But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride;
And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.
   And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail:
And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,
The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.
   And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,
And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;
And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,
Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!</poem_text>

Lingering onward dreamily 
In an evening of July — 
Children three that nestle near, 
Eager eye and willing ear, 
Pleased a simple tale to hear — 
Long has paled that sunny sky: 
Echoes fade and memories die: 
Autumn frosts have slain July. 
Still she haunts me, phantomwise, 
Alice moving under skies 
Never seen by waking eyes. 
Children yet, the tale to hear, 
Eager eye and willing ear, 
Lovingly shall nestle near. 
In a Wonderland they lie, 
Dreaming as the days go by, 
Dreaming as the summers die: 
Ever drifting down the stream — 
Lingering in the golden gleam — 
Life, what is it but a dream?</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Death, be not proud, though some have called thee 
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so; 
For those whom thou think&#39;st thou dost overthrow 
Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me. 
From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be, 
Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow, 
And soonest our best men with thee do go, 
Rest of their bones, and soul&#39;s delivery. 
Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men, 
And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell, 
And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well 
And better than thy stroke; why swell&#39;st thou then? 
One short sleep past, we wake eternally 
And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.</poem_text>

		<title>The Old Clock on the Stairs</title>
		<poem_text>Somewhat back from the village street 
Stands the old-fashioned country-seat. 
Across its antique portico 
Tall poplar-trees their shadows throw; 
And from its station in the hall 
An ancient timepiece says to all, — 
      &quot;Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!&quot; 
Half-way up the stairs it stands, 
And points and beckons with its hands 
From its case of massive oak, 
Like a monk, who, under his cloak, 
Crosses himself, and sighs, alas! 
With sorrowful voice to all who pass, — 
      &quot;Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!&quot; 
By day its voice is low and light; 
But in the silent dead of night, 
Distinct as a passing footstep&#39;s fall, 
It echoes along the vacant hall, 
Along the ceiling, along the floor, 
And seems to say, at each chamber-door, — 
      &quot;Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!&quot; 
Through days of sorrow and of mirth, 
Through days of death and days of birth, 
Through every swift vicissitude 
Of changeful time, unchanged it has stood, 
And as if, like God, it all things saw, 
It calmly repeats those words of awe, — 
      &quot;Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!&quot; 
In that mansion used to be 
Free-hearted Hospitality; 
His great fires up the chimney roared; 
The stranger feasted at his board; 
But, like the skeleton at the feast, 
That warning timepiece never ceased, — 
      &quot;Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!&quot; 
There groups of merry children played, 
There youths and maidens dreaming strayed; 
O precious hours! O golden prime, 
And affluence of love and time! 
Even as a miser counts his gold, 
Those hours the ancient timepiece told, — 
      &quot;Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!&quot; 
From that chamber, clothed in white, 
The bride came forth on her wedding night; 
There, in that silent room below, 
The dead lay in his shroud of snow; 
And in the hush that followed the prayer, 
Was heard the old clock on the stair, — 
      &quot;Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!&quot; 
All are scattered now and fled, 
Some are married, some are dead; 
And when I ask, with throbs of pain, 
&quot;Ah! when shall they all meet again?&quot; 
As in the days long since gone by, 
The ancient timepiece makes reply, — 
      &quot;Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!&quot; 
Never here, forever there, 
Where all parting, pain, and care, 
And death, and time shall disappear, — 
Forever there, but never here! 
The horologe of Eternity 
Sayeth this incessantly, — 
      &quot;Forever — never! 
      Never — forever!&quot;</poem_text>

The twilight darkens, the curlew calls; 
Along the sea-sands damp and brown 
The traveller hastens toward the town,

Darkness settles on roofs and walls, 
But the sea, the sea in the darkness calls; 
The little waves, with their soft, white hands, 
Efface the footprints in the sands, 
      And the tide rises, the tide falls. 
The morning breaks; the steeds in their stalls 
Stamp and neigh, as the hostler calls; 
The day returns, but nevermore 
Returns the traveller to the shore,

		<title>The Seafarer</title>
		<poem_text>May I for my own self song&#39;s truth reckon,
Journey&#39;s jargon, how I in harsh days
Hardship endured oft.
Bitter breast-cares have I abided,
Known on my keel many a care&#39;s hold,
And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship&#39;s head
While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,
My feet were by frost benumbed.
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs
Hew my heart round and hunger begot
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not
That he on dry land loveliest liveth,
List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,
Weathered the winter, wretched outcast
Deprived of my kinsmen;
Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,
There I heard naught save the harsh sea
And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,
Did for my games the gannet&#39;s clamour,
Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,
The mews&#39; singing all my mead-drink.
Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed
With spray on his pinion.
                     Not any protector
May make merry man faring needy.
This he little believes, who aye in winsome life
Abides &#39;mid burghers some heavy business,
Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft
Must bide above brine.
Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,
Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now
The heart&#39;s thought that I on high streams
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.
Moaneth alway my mind&#39;s lust
That I fare forth, that I afar hence
Seek out a foreign fastness.
For this there&#39;s no mood-lofty man over earth&#39;s midst,
Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;
Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare
Whatever his lord will.
He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having
Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world&#39;s delight
Nor any whit else save the wave&#39;s slash,
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.
Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,
Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,
All this admonisheth man eager of mood,
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks
On flood-ways to be far departing.
Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,
He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,
The bitter heart&#39;s blood. Burgher knows not ?
He the prosperous man ? what some perform
Where wandering them widest draweth.
So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,
My mood &#39;mid the mere-flood,
Over the whale&#39;s acre, would wander wide.
On earth&#39;s shelter cometh oft to me,
Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,
Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,
O&#39;er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow
My lord deems to me this dead life
On loan and on land, I believe not
That any earth-weal eternal standeth
Save there be somewhat calamitous
That, ere a man&#39;s tide go, turn it to twain.
Disease or oldness or sword-hate
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.
And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after ?
Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,
That he will work ere he pass onward,
Frame on the fair earth &#39;gainst foes his malice,
Daring ado, ...
So that all men shall honour him after
And his laud beyond them remain &#39;mid the English,
Aye, for ever, a lasting life&#39;s-blast,
Delight mid the doughty.
                     Days little durable,
And all arrogance of earthen riches,
There come now no kings nor Cæsars
Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.
Howe&#39;er in mirth most magnified,
Whoe&#39;er lived in life most lordliest,
Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!
Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.
Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.
Earthly glory ageth and seareth.
No man at all going the earth&#39;s gait,
But age fares against him, his face paleth,
Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,
Lordly men are to earth o&#39;ergiven,
Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,
Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,
Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart,
And though he strew the grave with gold,
His born brothers, their buried bodies
Be an unlikely treasure hoard.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>         Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!
                Bird thou never wert,
         That from Heaven, or near it,
                Pourest thy full heart
In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
         Higher still and higher
                From the earth thou springest
         Like a cloud of fire;
                The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
         In the golden lightning
                Of the sunken sun,
         O&#39;er which clouds are bright&#39;ning,
                Thou dost float and run;
Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.
         The pale purple even
                Melts around thy flight;
         Like a star of Heaven,
                In the broad day-light
Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight,
         Keen as are the arrows
                Of that silver sphere,
         Whose intense lamp narrows
                In the white dawn clear
Until we hardly see, we feel that it is there.
         All the earth and air
                With thy voice is loud,
         As, when night is bare,
                From one lonely cloud
The moon rains out her beams, and Heaven is overflow&#39;d.
         What thou art we know not;
                What is most like thee?
         From rainbow clouds there flow not
                Drops so bright to see
As from thy presence showers a rain of melody.
         Like a Poet hidden
                In the light of thought,
         Singing hymns unbidden,
                Till the world is wrought
To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:
         Like a high-born maiden
                In a palace-tower,
         Soothing her love-laden
                Soul in secret hour
With music sweet as love, which overflows her bower:
         Like a glow-worm golden
                In a dell of dew,
         Scattering unbeholden
                Its a{:e}real hue
Among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view:
         Like a rose embower&#39;d
                In its own green leaves,
         By warm winds deflower&#39;d,
                Till the scent it gives
Makes faint with too much sweet those heavy-winged thieves:
         Sound of vernal showers
                On the twinkling grass,
         Rain-awaken&#39;d flowers,
                All that ever was
Joyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass.
         Teach us, Sprite or Bird,
                What sweet thoughts are thine:
         I have never heard
                Praise of love or wine
That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
         Chorus Hymeneal,
                Or triumphal chant,
         Match&#39;d with thine would be all
                But an empty vaunt,
A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.
         What objects are the fountains
                Of thy happy strain?
         What fields, or waves, or mountains?
                What shapes of sky or plain?
What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?
         With thy clear keen joyance
                Languor cannot be:
         Shadow of annoyance
                Never came near thee:
Thou lovest: but ne&#39;er knew love&#39;s sad satiety.
         Waking or asleep,
                Thou of death must deem
         Things more true and deep
                Than we mortals dream,
Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
         We look before and after,
                And pine for what is not:
         Our sincerest laughter
                With some pain is fraught;
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
         Yet if we could scorn
                Hate, and pride, and fear;
         If we were things born
                Not to shed a tear,
I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.
         Better than all measures
                Of delightful sound,
         Better than all treasures
                That in books are found,
Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!
         Teach me half the gladness
                That thy brain must know,
         Such harmonious madness
                From my lips would flow
The world should listen then, as I am listening now.</poem_text>

		<title>I Sing the Body Electric</title>
		<poem_text>1 
I sing the body electric, 
The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them, 
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, 
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul. 
Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves? 
And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead? 
And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul? 
And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul? 
2 
The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account, 
That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect. 
The expression of the face balks account, 
But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face, 
It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, 
It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him, 
The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth, 
To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more, 
You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side. 
The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards, 
The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water, 
The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle, 
Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances, 
The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting, 
The female soothing a child, the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard, 
The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd, 
The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sun-down after work, 
The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance, 
The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes; 
The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps, 
The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert, 
The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv’d neck and the counting; 
Such-like I love—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the little child, 
Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count.

I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons, 
And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons. 
This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person, 
The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners, 
These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also, 
He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome, 
They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him, 
They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love, 
He drank water only, the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face, 
He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail’d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him, 
When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang, 
You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other. 
4 
I have perceiv’d that to be with those I like is enough, 
To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough, 
To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough, 
To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then? 
I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea. 
There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well, 
All things please the soul, but these please the soul well. 
5 
This is the female form, 
A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot, 
It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, 
I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it, 
Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear’d of hell, are now consumed, 
Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable, 
Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused, 
Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching, 
Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice, 
Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn, 
Undulating into the willing and yielding day, 
Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh’d day. 
This the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman, 
This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again. 
Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest, 
You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul. 
The female contains all qualities and tempers them, 
She is in her place and moves with perfect balance, 
She is all things duly veil’d, she is both passive and active, 
She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters. 
As I see my soul reflected in Nature, 
As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty, 
See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see. 
6 
The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place, 
He too is all qualities, he is action and power, 
The flush of the known universe is in him, 
Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well, 
The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him, 
The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul, 
Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself, 
Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here, 
(Where else does he strike soundings except here?) 
The man’s body is sacred and the woman’s body is sacred, 
No matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the laborers’ gang? 
Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf? 
Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as you, 
Each has his or her place in the procession. 
(All is a procession, 
The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.) 
Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant? 
Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight? 
Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts, 
For you only, and not for him and her? 
7 
A man’s body at auction, 
(For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,) 
I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business. 
Gentlemen look on this wonder, 
Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it, 
For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant, 
For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll’d. 
In this head the all-baffling brain, 
In it and below it the makings of heroes. 
Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve, 
They shall be stript that you may see them. 
Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition, 
Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs, 
And wonders within there yet. 
Within there runs blood, 
The same old blood! the same red-running blood! 
There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations, 
(Do you think they are not there because they are not express’d in parlors and lecture-rooms?) 
This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns, 
In him the start of populous states and rich republics, 
Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments. 
How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries? 
(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries?) 
8 
A woman’s body at auction, 
She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers, 
She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers. 
Have you ever loved the body of a woman? 
Have you ever loved the body of a man? 
Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth? 
If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred, 
And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted, 
And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the most beautiful face. 
Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body? 
For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves. 
9 
O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the parts of you, 
I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the soul, (and that they are the soul,) 
I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems, and that they are my poems, 
Man’s, woman’s, child’s, youth’s, wife’s, husband’s, mother’s, father’s, young man’s, young woman’s poems, 
Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears, 
Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eyebrows, and the waking or sleeping of the lids, 
Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-hinges, 
Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition, 
Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue, 
Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample side-round of the chest, 
Upper-arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones, 
Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, forefinger, finger-joints, finger-nails, 
Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-side, 
Ribs, belly, backbone, joints of the backbone, 
Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls, man-root, 
Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above, 
Leg fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under-leg, 
Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel; 
All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your body or of any one’s body, male or female, 
The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean, 
The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame, 
Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity, 
Womanhood, and all that is a woman, and the man that comes from woman, 
The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and risings, 
The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud, 
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming, 
Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening, 
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes, 
The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair, 
The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body, 
The circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and out, 
The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees, 
The thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the marrow in the bones, 
The exquisite realization of health; 
O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul, 
O I say now these are the soul!</poem_text>

		<title>My Triumph</title>
		<poem_text>The autumn-time has come;
On woods that dream of bloom,
And over purpling vines,
The low sun fainter shines.
The aster-flower is failing,
The hazel’s gold is paling;
Yet overhead more near
The eternal stars appear!
And present gratitude
Insures the future’s good,
And for the things I see
I trust the things to be;
That in the paths untrod,
And the long days of God,
My feet shall still be led,
My heart be comforted.
O living friends who love me!
O dear ones gone above me!
Careless of other fame,
I leave to you my name.
Hide it from idle praises,
Save it from evil phrases:
Why, when dear lips that spake it
Are dumb, should strangers wake it?
Let the thick curtain fall;
I better know than all
How little I have gained,
How vast the unattained.
Not by the page word-painted
Let life be banned or sainted:
Deeper than written scroll
The colors of the soul.
Sweeter than any sung
My songs that found no tongue;
Nobler than any fact
My wish that failed of act.
Others shall sing the song,
Others shall right the wrong,—
Finish what I begin,
And all I fail of win.
What matter, I or they?
Mine or another’s day,
So the right word be said
And life the sweeter made?
Hail to the coming singers!
Hail to the brave light-bringers!
Forward I reach and share
All that they sing and dare.
The airs of heaven blow o’er me;
A glory shines before me
Of what mankind shall be,—
Pure, generous, brave, and free.
A dream of man and woman
Diviner but still human,
Solving the riddle old,
Shaping the Age of Gold!
The love of God and neighbor;
An equal-handed labor;
The richer life, where beauty
Walks hand in hand with duty.
Ring, bells in unreared steeples,
The joy of unborn peoples!
Sound, trumpets far off blown,
Your triumph is my own!
Parcel and part of all,
I keep the festival,
Fore-reach the good to be,
And share the victory.
I feel the earth move sunward,
I join the great march onward,
And take, by faith, while living,
My freehold of thanksgiving.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Of the sleeves, I remember their weight, like wet wool,

Of the body of the shirt, I remember the large buttons

down my chest and could not be quickly unbuttoned.   
Of the collar, I remember its thickness without starch, 
by which it lay against my clavicle without moving.   
Of my trousers, the same—heavy, bulky, slow to give   
for a leg, a crowded feeling, a molasses to walk in.   
Of my boots, I remember the brittle soles, of a material   
that had not been made love to by any natural substance,   
and the laces: ropes to make prisoners of my feet.   
Of the helmet, I remember the webbed, inner liner,   
a brittle plastic underwear on which wobbled 
the crushing steel pot then strapped at the chin.   
Of the mortar, I remember the mortar plate, 
heavy enough to kill by weight, which I carried by rope.   
Of the machine gun, I remember the way it fit 
behind my head and across my shoulder blades   
as I carried it, or, to be precise, as it rode me. 
Of tactics, I remember the likelihood of shooting 
the wrong man, the weight of the rifle bolt, the difficulty   
of loading while prone, the shock of noise. 
For earplugs, some used cigarette filters or toilet paper.   
I don’t hear well now, for a man of my age,

					              I. The Burial of the Dead
  April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing 
Memory and desire, stirring 
Dull roots with spring rain. 
Winter kept us warm, covering 
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding 
A little life with dried tubers. 
Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee 
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade, 
And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, 
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour. 
Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch. 
And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke’s, 
My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled, 
And I was frightened. He said, Marie, 
Marie, hold on tight. And down we went. 
In the mountains, there you feel free. 
I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter. 
  What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow 
Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man, 
You cannot say, or guess, for you know only 
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats, 
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief, 
And the dry stone no sound of water. Only 
There is shadow under this red rock, 
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock), 
And I will show you something different from either 
Your shadow at morning striding behind you 
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you; 
I will show you fear in a handful of dust. 
                      Frisch weht der Wind 
                      Der Heimat zu 
                      Mein Irisch Kind, 
                      Wo weilest du? 
“You gave me hyacinths first a year ago; 
“They called me the hyacinth girl.”
—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden, 
Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not 
Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither 
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing, 
Looking into the heart of light, the silence. 
Oed’ und leer das Meer. 
  Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante, 
Had a bad cold, nevertheless 
Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe, 
With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she, 
Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor, 
(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!) 
Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks, 
The lady of situations. 
Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel, 
And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card, 
Which is blank, is something he carries on his back, 
Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find 
The Hanged Man. Fear death by water. 
I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring. 
Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone, 
Tell her I bring the horoscope myself: 
One must be so careful these days. 
  Unreal City, 
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn, 
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, 
I had not thought death had undone so many. 
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled, 
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet. 
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street, 
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours 
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine. 
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: “Stetson! 
“You who were with me in the ships at Mylae! 
“That corpse you planted last year in your garden, 
“Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? 
“Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed? 
“Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men, 
“Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again! 
“You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!”
              II. A Game of Chess
The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne, 
Glowed on the marble, where the glass 
Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines 
From which a golden Cupidon peeped out 
(Another hid his eyes behind his wing) 
Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra 
Reflecting light upon the table as 
The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it, 
From satin cases poured in rich profusion; 
In vials of ivory and coloured glass 
Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes, 
Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused 
And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air 
That freshened from the window, these ascended 
In fattening the prolonged candle-flames, 
Flung their smoke into the laquearia, 
Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling. 
Huge sea-wood fed with copper 
Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone, 
In which sad light a carvéd dolphin swam. 
Above the antique mantel was displayed 
As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene 
The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king 
So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale 
Filled all the desert with inviolable voice 
And still she cried, and still the world pursues, 
“Jug Jug” to dirty ears. 
And other withered stumps of time 
Were told upon the walls; staring forms 
Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed. 
Footsteps shuffled on the stair. 
Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair 
Spread out in fiery points 
Glowed into words, then would be savagely still. 
  “My nerves are bad tonight. Yes, bad. Stay with me. 
“Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak. 
  “What are you thinking of? What thinking? What? 
“I never know what you are thinking. Think.”
  I think we are in rats’ alley 
Where the dead men lost their bones. 
  “What is that noise?”
                          The wind under the door. 
“What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?” 
                           Nothing again nothing. 
                                                        “Do 
“You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember 
“Nothing?”
       I remember 
Those are pearls that were his eyes. 
“Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?”   
           
                                                                           But 
O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag— 
It’s so elegant 
So intelligent 
“What shall I do now? What shall I do?” 
“I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street 
“With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow? 
“What shall we ever do?” 
                                               The hot water at ten. 
And if it rains, a closed car at four. 
And we shall play a game of chess, 
Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door. 
  When Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said— 
I didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself, 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME 
Now Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart. 
He’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you 
To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there. 
You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set, 
He said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you. 
And no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert, 
He’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time, 
And if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said. 
Oh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said. 
Then I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look. 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME 
If you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said.
Others can pick and choose if you can’t. 
But if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling. 
You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique. 
(And her only thirty-one.) 
I can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face, 
It’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said. 
(She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.) 
The chemist said it would be all right, but I’ve never been the same. 
You are a proper fool, I said. 
Well, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said, 
What you get married for if you don’t want children? 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME 
Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon, 
And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot— 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME 
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME 
Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight.

              III. The Fire Sermon
  The river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf 
Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind 
Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed. 
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song. 
The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers, 
Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends 
Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed. 
And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors; 
Departed, have left no addresses. 
By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . . 
Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song, 
Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long. 
But at my back in a cold blast I hear 
The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear. 
A rat crept softly through the vegetation 
Dragging its slimy belly on the bank 
While I was fishing in the dull canal 
On a winter evening round behind the gashouse 
Musing upon the king my brother’s wreck 
And on the king my father’s death before him. 
White bodies naked on the low damp ground 
And bones cast in a little low dry garret, 
Rattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year. 
But at my back from time to time I hear 
The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring 
Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring. 
O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter 
And on her daughter 
They wash their feet in soda water 
Et O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole! 
Twit twit twit 
Jug jug jug jug jug jug 
So rudely forc’d. 
Tereu 
Unreal City 
Under the brown fog of a winter noon 
Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant 
Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants 
C.i.f. London: documents at sight, 
Asked me in demotic French 
To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel 
Followed by a weekend at the Metropole. 
At the violet hour, when the eyes and back 
Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits 
Like a taxi throbbing waiting, 
I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives, 
Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see 
At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives 
Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea, 
The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights 
Her stove, and lays out food in tins. 
Out of the window perilously spread 
Her drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays, 
On the divan are piled (at night her bed) 
Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays. 
I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs 
Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest— 
I too awaited the expected guest. 
He, the young man carbuncular, arrives, 
A small house agent’s clerk, with one bold stare, 
One of the low on whom assurance sits 
As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire. 
The time is now propitious, as he guesses, 
The meal is ended, she is bored and tired, 
Endeavours to engage her in caresses 
Which still are unreproved, if undesired. 
Flushed and decided, he assaults at once; 
Exploring hands encounter no defence; 
His vanity requires no response, 
And makes a welcome of indifference. 
(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all 
Enacted on this same divan or bed; 
I who have sat by Thebes below the wall 
And walked among the lowest of the dead.) 
Bestows one final patronising kiss, 
And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . . 
She turns and looks a moment in the glass, 
Hardly aware of her departed lover; 
Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass: 
“Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.”
When lovely woman stoops to folly and 
Paces about her room again, alone, 
She smoothes her hair with automatic hand, 
And puts a record on the gramophone. 
“This music crept by me upon the waters” 
And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street. 
O City city, I can sometimes hear 
Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street, 
The pleasant whining of a mandoline 
And a clatter and a chatter from within 
Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls 
Of Magnus Martyr hold 
Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold. 
               The river sweats 
               Oil and tar 
               The barges drift 
               With the turning tide 
               Red sails 
               Wide 
               To leeward, swing on the heavy spar. 
               The barges wash 
               Drifting logs 
               Down Greenwich reach 
               Past the Isle of Dogs. 
                                 Weialala leia 
                                 Wallala leialala
               Elizabeth and Leicester 
               Beating oars 
               The stern was formed 
               A gilded shell 
               Red and gold 
               The brisk swell 
               Rippled both shores 
               Southwest wind 
               Carried down stream 
               The peal of bells 
               White towers

“Trams and dusty trees. 
Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew 
Undid me. By Richmond I raised my knees 
Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe.”
“My feet are at Moorgate, and my heart 
Under my feet. After the event 
He wept. He promised a ‘new start.’ 
I made no comment. What should I resent?” 
“On Margate Sands. 
I can connect 
Nothing with nothing. 
The broken fingernails of dirty hands. 
My people humble people who expect 
Nothing.”

To Carthage then I came 
Burning burning burning burning

              IV. Death by Water
Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead, 
Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell 
And the profit and loss. 
                                   A current under sea 
Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell 
He passed the stages of his age and youth 
Entering the whirlpool. 
                                   Gentile or Jew 
O you who turn the wheel and look to windward, 
Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you. 
              V. What the Thunder Said
  After the torchlight red on sweaty faces 
After the frosty silence in the gardens 
After the agony in stony places 
The shouting and the crying 
Prison and palace and reverberation 
Of thunder of spring over distant mountains 
He who was living is now dead 
We who were living are now dying 
With a little patience 
Here is no water but only rock 
Rock and no water and the sandy road 
The road winding above among the mountains 
Which are mountains of rock without water 
If there were water we should stop and drink 
Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think 
Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand 
If there were only water amongst the rock 
Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit 
Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit 
There is not even silence in the mountains 
But dry sterile thunder without rain 
There is not even solitude in the mountains 
But red sullen faces sneer and snarl 
From doors of mudcracked houses 
                                      If there were water 
   And no rock 
   If there were rock 
   And also water 
   And water 
   A spring 
   A pool among the rock 
   If there were the sound of water only 
   Not the cicada 
   And dry grass singing 
   But sound of water over a rock 
   Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees 
   Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop 
   But there is no water 
Who is the third who walks always beside you? 
When I count, there are only you and I together 
But when I look ahead up the white road 
There is always another one walking beside you 
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded 
I do not know whether a man or a woman 
—But who is that on the other side of you? 
What is that sound high in the air 
Murmur of maternal lamentation 
Who are those hooded hordes swarming 
Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth 
Ringed by the flat horizon only 
What is the city over the mountains 
Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air 
Falling towers 
Jerusalem Athens Alexandria 
Vienna London 
Unreal 
A woman drew her long black hair out tight 
And fiddled whisper music on those strings 
And bats with baby faces in the violet light 
Whistled, and beat their wings 
And crawled head downward down a blackened wall 
And upside down in air were towers 
Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours 
And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells. 
In this decayed hole among the mountains 
In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing 
Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel 
There is the empty chapel, only the wind’s home. 
It has no windows, and the door swings, 
Dry bones can harm no one. 
Only a cock stood on the rooftree 
Co co rico co co rico 
In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust 
Bringing rain 
Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves 
Waited for rain, while the black clouds 
Gathered far distant, over Himavant. 
The jungle crouched, humped in silence. 
Then spoke the thunder 
DA 
Datta: what have we given? 
My friend, blood shaking my heart 
The awful daring of a moment’s surrender 
Which an age of prudence can never retract 
By this, and this only, we have existed 
Which is not to be found in our obituaries 
Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider 
Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor 
In our empty rooms
DA 
Dayadhvam: I have heard the key 
Turn in the door once and turn once only 
We think of the key, each in his prison 
Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison 
Only at nightfall, aethereal rumours 
Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus 
DA 
Damyata: The boat responded 
Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar 
The sea was calm, your heart would have responded 
Gaily, when invited, beating obedient 
To controlling hands 
 
                                    I sat upon the shore 
Fishing, with the arid plain behind me 
Shall I at least set my lands in order? 
London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down 
Poi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina 
Quando fiam uti chelidon—O swallow swallow 
Le Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie 
These fragments I have shored against my ruins 
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo’s mad againe. 
Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.

   And ransack heaven before our moment fails.   
Now, in a breath, before we, too, grow old, 
   We’ll mount and sing and spread immortal sails. 
It is not time that makes eternity. 
   Love and an hour may quite out-span the years,   
And give us more to hear and more to see   
   Than life can wash away with all its tears. 
Dear, when we part, at last, that sunset sky 
   Shall not be touched with deeper hues than this;   
But we shall ride the lightning ere we die 
   And seize our brief infinitude of bliss, 
With time to spare for all that heaven can tell,   
While eyes meet eyes, and look their last farewell.</poem_text>

Such plainness of the pre-baroque pre-baroque In Larkin’s pronunciation, the phrase rhymes with &#39;shock.&#39; The Baroque period, exemplified by ornamentation, followed the Renaissance. This tomb was sculpted in the Middle Ages.

Each summer thronged the glass. A bright

		<title>A Short History of the Shadow</title>
		<poem_text>Thanksgiving, dark of the moon. 
Nothing down here in the underworld but vague shapes and black holes,   
Heaven resplendent but virtual 
Above me, 
               trees stripped and triple-wired like Irish harps.   
Lights on Pantops and Free Bridge mirror the eastern sky.   
Under the bridge is the river, 
                                              the red Rivanna. 
Under the river’s redemption, it says in the book,   
It says in the book, 
Through water and fire the whole place becomes purified,   
The visible by the visible, the hidden by what is hidden. 
________ 
Each word, as someone once wrote, contains the universe.   
The visible carries all the invisible on its back. 
Tonight, in the unconditional, what moves in the long-limbed grasses,   
                                                                                 what touches me   
As though I didn’t exist? 
What is it that keeps on moving, 
                                                 a tiny pillar of smoke   
Erect on its hind legs, 
                                    loose in the hollow grasses? 
A word I don’t know yet, a little word, containing infinity,   
Noiseless and unrepentant, in sift through the dry grass.   
Under the tongue is the utterance. 
Under the utterance is the fire, and then the only end of fire. 
________ 
Only Dante, in Purgatory, casts a shadow, 
L’ombra della carne, the shadow of flesh— 
                                                                        everyone else is one. 
The darkness that flows from the world’s body, gloomy spot,   
Pre-dogs our footsteps, and follows us, 
                                                            diaphanous bodies 
Watching the nouns circle, and watching the verbs circle,   
Till one of them enters the left ear and becomes a shadow   
Itself, sweet word in the unwaxed ear. 
This is a short history of the shadow, one part of us that’s real.   
This is the way the world looks 
In late November, 
            no leaves on the trees, no ledge to foil the lightfall. 
________ 
No ledge in early December either, and no ice,   
La Niña unhosing the heat pump 
                                              up from the Gulf, 
Orange Crush sunset over the Blue Ridge, 
No shadow from anything as evening gathers its objects   
And eases into earshot. 
Under the influx the outtake, 
                                             Leon Battista Alberti says,   
Some lights are from stars, some from the sun 
And moon, and other lights are from fires. 
The light from the stars makes the shadow equal to the body.   
Light from fire makes it greater, 
                there, under the tongue, there, under the utterance.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Darkened by time, the masters, like our memories, mix   
And mismatch, 
 and settle about our lawn furniture, like air   
Without a meaning, like air in its clear nothingness. 
What can we say to either of them? 
How can they be so dark and so clear at the same time?   
They ruffle our hair, 
 they ruffle the leaves of the August trees.   
Then stop, abruptly as wind. 
The flies come back, and the heat— 
 what can we say to them?   
Nothing is endless but the sky. 
The flies come back, and the afternoon 
Teeters a bit on its green edges, 
 then settles like dead weight   
Next to our memories, and the pale hems of the masters’ gowns.
________

 
Those who look for the Lord will cry out in praise of him. 
Perhaps. And perhaps not— 
 dust and ashes though we are,   
Some will go wordlessly, some 
Will listen their way in with their mouths 
Where pain puts them, an inch-and-a-half above the floor.   
And some will revile him out of love 
 and deep disdain. 
The gates of mercy, like an eclipse, darken our undersides.   
Rows of gravestones stay our steps, 
 August humidity 
Bright as auras around our bodies. 
And some will utter the words, 
 speaking in fear and tongues,   
Hating their garments splotched by the flesh. 
These are the lucky ones, the shelved ones, the twice-erased.

Dante and John Chrysostom 
Might find this afternoon a sidereal roadmap,   
A pilgrim’s way ... 
 You might too 
Under the prejaundiced outline of the quarter moon,   
Clouds sculling downsky like a narrative for whatever comes, 
What hasn’t happened to happen yet 
Still lurking behind the stars, 
 31 August 1995 ... 
The afterlife of insects, space graffiti, white holes   
In the landscape, 
 such things, such avenues, lead to dust 
And handle our hurt with ease. 
Sky blue, blue of infinity, blue 
 waters above the earth: 
Why do the great stories always exist in the past?

The unexamined life’s no different from 
 the examined life— 
Unanswerable questions, small talk,

Of evening, 
 you’ve got to write it down. 
Memory’s handkerchief, death’s dream and automobile, 
God’s sleep, 
 you’ve still got to write it down, 
Moon half-empty, moon half-full, 
Night starless and egoless, night blood-black and prayer-black,   
Spider at work between the hedges, 
Last bird call, 
 toad in a damp place, tree frog in a dry ...
________

 
We go to our graves with secondary affections, 
Second-hand satisfaction, half-souled, 
 star charts demagnetized. 
We go in our best suits. The birds are flying. Clouds pass.   
Sure we’re cold and untouchable, 
 but we harbor no ill will. 
No tooth tuned to resentment’s fork, 
 we’re out of here, and sweet meat.   
Calligraphers of the disembodied, God’s word-wards, 
What letters will we illuminate? 
Above us, the atmosphere, 
The nothing that’s nowhere, signs on, and waits for our beck and call. 
Above us, the great constellations sidle and wince, 
The letters undarken and come forth, 
Your X and my X. 
 The letters undarken and they come forth.
________

 
Eluders of memory, nocturnal sleep of the greenhouse,   
Spirit of slides and silences, 
 Invisible Hand, 
Witness and walk on. 
Lords of the discontinuous, lords of the little gestures,   
Succor my shift and save me ... 
All afternoon the rain has rained down in the mind,   
And in the gardens and dwarf orchard. 
 All afternoon 
The lexicon of late summer has turned its pages   
Under the rain, 
 abstracting the necessary word.   
Autumn’s upon us. 
The rain fills our narrow beds. 
Description’s an element, like air or water. 
 That’s the word.</poem_text>

B. YEATS, Autobiographies
					1. The Ministry of Fear 
       for Seamus Deane 
Well, as Kavanagh said, we have lived   
In important places. The lonely scarp 
Of St Columb’s College, where I billeted   
For six years, overlooked your Bogside. 
I gazed into new worlds: the inflamed throat   
Of Brandywell, its floodlit dogtrack,   
The throttle of the hare. In the first week   
I was so homesick I couldn’t even eat   
The biscuits left to sweeten my exile.   
I threw them over the fence one night   
In September 1951 
When the lights of houses in the Lecky Road   
Were amber in the fog. It was an act   
Of stealth. 
                  Then Belfast, and then Berkeley. 
Here’s two on’s are sophisticated, 
Dabbling in verses till they have become   
A life: from bulky envelopes arriving   
In vacation time to slim volumes 
Despatched `with the author’s compliments’. 
Those poems in longhand, ripped from the wire spine   
Of your exercise book, bewildered me— 
Vowels and ideas bandied free 
As the seed-pods blowing off our sycamores.   
I tried to write about the sycamores 
And innovated a South Derry rhyme 
With hushed and lulled full chimes for pushed and pulled.   
Those hobnailed boots from beyond the mountain   
Were walking, by God, all over the fine   
Lawns of elocution. 
                              Have our accents 
Changed? ‘Catholics, in general, don’t speak 
As well as students from the Protestant schools.’   
Remember that stuff? Inferiority 
Complexes, stuff that dreams were made on.   
‘What’s your name, Heaney?’ 
                                          ‘Heaney, Father.’ 
                                                                     ‘Fair 
Enough.’ 
             On my first day, the leather strap 
Went epileptic in the Big Study, 
Its echoes plashing over our bowed heads, 
But I still wrote home that a boarder’s life 
Was not so bad, shying as usual. 
On long vacations, then, I came to life   
In the kissing seat of an Austin 16 
Parked at a gable, the engine running,   
My fingers tight as ivy on her shoulders,   
A light left burning for her in the kitchen.   
And heading back for home, the summer’s   
Freedom dwindling night by night, the air   
All moonlight and a scent of hay, policemen   
Swung their crimson flashlamps, crowding round   
The car like black cattle, snuffing and pointing 
The muzzle of a Sten gun in my eye:   
‘What’s your name, driver?’ 
                                          ‘Seamus ...’ 
                                                         Seamus? 
They once read my letters at a roadblock 
And shone their torches on your hieroglyphics,   
‘Svelte dictions’ in a very florid hand. 
Ulster was British, but with no rights on   
The English lyric: all around us, though   
We hadn’t named it, the ministry of fear. 
2. A Constable Calls 
His bicycle stood at the window-sill,   
The rubber cowl of a mud-splasher   
Skirting the front mudguard, 
Its fat black handlegrips 
Heating in sunlight, the ‘spud’ 
Of the dynamo gleaming and cocked back,   
The pedal treads hanging relieved 
Of the boot of the law. 
His cap was upside down 
On the floor, next his chair. 
The line of its pressure ran like a bevel   
In his slightly sweating hair. 
He had unstrapped 
The heavy ledger, and my father   
Was making tillage returns 
In acres, roods, and perches. 
Arithmetic and fear. 
I sat staring at the polished holster   
With its buttoned flap, the braid cord   
Looped into the revolver butt. 
‘Any other root crops? 
Mangolds? Marrowstems? Anything like that?’   
‘No.’ But was there not a line 
Of turnips where the seed ran out 
In the potato field? I assumed 
Small guilts and sat 
Imagining the black hole in the barracks.   
He stood up, shifted the baton-case 
Farther round on his belt, 
Closed the domesday book, 
Fitted his cap back with two hands,   
And looked at me as he said goodbye. 
A shadow bobbed in the window.   
He was snapping the carrier spring   
Over the ledger. His boot pushed off   
And the bicycle ticked, ticked, ticked. 
3. Orange Drums, Tyrone, 1966 
The lambeg balloons at his belly, weighs 
Him back on his haunches, lodging thunder 
Grossly there between his chin and his knees.   
He is raised up by what he buckles under. 
Each arm extended by a seasoned rod, 
He parades behind it. And though the drummers   
Are granted passage through the nodding crowd,   
It is the drums preside, like giant tumours. 
To every cocked ear, expert in its greed, 
His battered signature subscribes ‘No Pope’. 
The goatskin’s sometimes plastered with his blood.   
The air is pounding like a stethoscope. 
4. Summer 1969 
While the Constabulary covered the mob   
Firing into the Falls, I was suffering 
Only the bullying sun of Madrid. 
Each afternoon, in the casserole heat 
Of the flat, as I sweated my way through   
The life of Joyce, stinks from the fishmarket   
Rose like the reek off a flax-dam. 
At night on the balcony, gules of wine, 
A sense of children in their dark corners, 
Old women in black shawls near open windows,   
The air a canyon rivering in Spanish. 
We talked our way home over starlit plains   
Where patent leather of the Guardia Civil   
Gleamed like fish-bellies in flax-poisoned waters. 
‘Go back,’ one said, ‘try to touch the people.’   
Another conjured Lorca from his hill. 
We sat through death-counts and bullfight reports   
On the television, celebrities 
Arrived from where the real thing still happened. 
I retreated to the cool of the Prado.   
Goya’s ‘Shootings of the Third of May’   
Covered a wall—the thrown-up arms   
And spasm of the rebel, the helmeted   
And knapsacked military, the efficient   
Rake of the fusillade. In the next room, 
His nightmares, grafted to the palace wall— 
Dark cyclones, hosting, breaking; Saturn   
Jewelled in the blood of his own children,   
Gigantic Chaos turning his brute hips   
Over the world. Also, that holmgang 
Where two berserks club each other to death   
For honour’s sake, greaved in a bog, and sinking. 
He painted with his fists and elbows, flourished 
The stained cape of his heart as history charged. 
5. Fosterage 
       for Michael McLaverty 
‘Description is revelation!’ Royal 
Avenue, Belfast, 1962, 
A Saturday afternoon, glad to meet 
Me, newly cubbed in language, he gripped   
My elbow. ‘Listen. Go your own way. 
Do your own work. Remember 
Katherine Mansfield—I will tell 
How the laundry basket squeaked ... that note of exile.’   
But to hell with overstating it: 
‘Don’t have the veins bulging in your Biro.’   
And then, ‘Poor Hopkins!’ I have the Journals 
He gave me, underlined, his buckled self   
Obeisant to their pain. He discerned 
The lineaments of patience everywhere 
And fostered me and sent me out, with words   
Imposing on my tongue like obols. 
6. Exposure 
It is December in Wicklow:   
Alders dripping, birches 
Inheriting the last light,   
The ash tree cold to look at. 
A comet that was lost 
Should be visible at sunset,   
Those million tons of light 
Like a glimmer of haws and rose-hips, 
And I sometimes see a falling star.   
If I could come on meteorite! 
Instead I walk through damp leaves,   
Husks, the spent flukes of autumn, 
Imagining a hero 
On some muddy compound,   
His gift like a clingstone   
Whirled for the desperate. 
How did I end up like this? 
I often think of my friends’ 
Beautiful prismatic counselling 
And the anvil brains of some who hate me 
As I sit weighing and weighing 
My responsible tristia. 
For what? For the ear? For the people?   
For what is said behind-backs? 
Rain comes down through the alders,   
Its low conducive voices 
Mutter about let-downs and erosions   
And yet each drop recalls 
The diamond absolutes. 
I am neither internee nor informer;   
An inner émigré, grown long-haired   
And thoughtful; a wood-kerne 
Escaped from the massacre,   
Taking protective colouring   
From bole and bark, feeling   
Every wind that blows; 
Who, blowing up these sparks 
For their meagre heat, have missed   
The once-in-a-lifetime portent,   
The comet’s pulsing rose.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Lie still, sleep becalmed, sufferer with the wound   
In the throat, burning and turning. All night afloat   
On the silent sea we have heard the sound 
That came from the wound wrapped in the salt sheet. 
Under the mile off moon we trembled listening 
To the sea sound flowing like blood from the loud wound   
And when the salt sheet broke in a storm of singing   
The voices of all the drowned swam on the wind. 
Open a pathway through the slow sad sail, 
Throw wide to the wind the gates of the wandering boat   
For my voyage to begin to the end of my wound,   
We heard the sea sound sing, we saw the salt sheet tell.   
Lie still, sleep becalmed, hide the mouth in the throat, 
Or we shall obey, and ride with you through the drowned.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>My gentle friend! I hold no creed so false
As that which dares to teach that we are born 
For battle only, and that in this life
The soul, if it would burn with starlike power, 
Must needs forsooth be kindled by the sparks 
Struck from the shock of clashing human hearts. 
There is a wisdom that grows up in strife, 
And one—I like it best—that sits at home 
And learns its lessons of a thoughtful ease.
So come! a lonely house awaits thee!—there 
Nor praise, nor blame shall reach us, save what love 
Of knowledge for itself shall wake at times 
In our own bosoms; come! and we will build 
A wall of quiet thought, and gentle books, 
Betwixt us and the hard and bitter world. 
Sometimes—for we need not be anchorites—
A distant friend shall cheer us through the Post, 
Or some Gazette—of course no partisan—
Shall bring us pleasant news of pleasant things; 
Then, twisted into graceful allumettes, 
Each ancient joke shall blaze with genuine flame 
To light our pipes and candles; but to wars, 
Whether of words or weapons, we shall be 
Deaf—so we twain shall pass away the time 
Ev’n as a pair of happy lovers, who,
Alone, within some quiet garden-nook,
With a clear night of stars above their heads, 
Just hear, betwixt their kisses and their talk, 
The tumult of a tempest rolling through
A chain of neighboring mountains; they awhile 
Pause to admire a flash that only shows 
The smile upon their faces, but, full soon, 
Turn with a quick, glad impulse, and perhaps 
A conscious wile that brings them closer yet, 
To dally with their own fond hearts, and play 
With the sweet flowers that blossom at their feet.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>The week in August you come home, 
adult, professional, aloof, 
we roast and carve the fatted calf 
—in our case home-grown pig, the chine 
garlicked and crisped, the applesauce 
hand-pressed. Hand-pressed the greengage wine. 
Nothing is cost-effective here. 
The peas, the beets, the lettuces 
hand sown, are raised to stand apart. 
The electric fence ticks like the slow heart 
of something we fed and bedded for a year, 
then killed with kindness’s one bullet 
and paid Jake Mott to do the butchering. 
In winter we lure the birds with suet, 
thaw lungs and kidneys for the cat. 
Darlings, it’s all a circle from the ring 
of wire that keeps the raccoons from the corn 
to the gouged pine table that we lounge around, 
distressed before any of you was born. 
Benign and dozy from our gluttonies, 
the candles down to stubs, defenses down, 
love leaking out unguarded the way 
juice dribbles from the fence when grounded 
by grass stalks or a forgotten hoe, 
how eloquent, how beautiful you seem! 
Wearing our gestures, how wise you grow, 
ballooning to overfill our space, 
the almost-parents of your parents now. 
So briefly having you back to measure us 
is harder than having let you go.</poem_text>

		<title>Last Days</title>
		<poem_text>We visit by phone as the morphine haze   
retreats, late afternoon, most days.   
Our mingled past is set against the pin-   
hole lights of cars cruising the blacked-out streets:   
we four in the college smoker popping No-Doz,   
honors students carrying heavy course loads   
tipped sideways by sex, one by one discarding   
our virginities on the altar of inverse pride,   
ironing our blouses with Peter Pan collars   
to wear on dates with those 90-day Wonders,   
ensigns in training for the Second World War   
in the Business School across the Charles River. 
We called ourselves the Unholy Four.   
Whenever any three of us met on campus   
we huddled to bray Austria! Russia! Prussia! 
in unison. It came out sounding like Horseshit! 
Post graduation one year, look at us:   
my new husband atop your even newer   
one&#39;s car singing the bawdy verses   
of &quot;Roll Me Over&quot; in a drunken tenor   
while the scandalized uncles and aunties   
—it wasn&#39;t enough that you&#39;d wed a Chinese—   
wrung their hands. You drove off   
trailing Just Married in two languages.   
Now BJ is gone, and Hettie. You have, they say,   
only days. It is my plan to go with you   
as far as the border. I&#39;ve been that far—   
Did I come back from there morally improved?   
Somehow better equipped to support you   
this side of the douane and wave,   
your two cats curled like commas beside you   
as the barrier lifts and you drive on through?</poem_text>

		<poem_text>Third Avenue in sunlight. Nature’s error.   
Already the bars are filled and John is there.   
Beneath a plentiful lady over the mirror   
He tilts his glass in the mild mahogany air. 
I think of him when he first got out of college,   
Serious, thin, unlikely to succeed; 
For several months he hung around the Village,   
Boldly T-shirted, unfettered but unfreed. 
Now he confides to a stranger, “I was first scout,   
And kept my glimmers peeled till after dark.   
Our outfit had as its sign a bloody knout,   
We met behind the museum in Central Park. 
Of course, we were kids.” But still those savages,   
War-painted, a flap of leather at the loins,   
File silently against him. Hostages 
Are never taken. One summer, in Des Moines, 
They entered his hotel room, tomahawks   
Flashing like barracuda. He tried to pray.   
Three years of treatment. Occasionally he talks   
About how he almost didn’t get away. 
Daily the prowling sunlight whets its knife   
Along the sidewalk. We almost never meet.   
In the Rembrandt dark he lifts his amber life.   
My bar is somewhat further down the street.</poem_text>

		<title>“More Light! More Light!”</title>
		<poem_text>for Heinrich Blücher and Hannah Arendt
					Composed in the Tower before his execution 
These moving verses, and being brought at that time   
Painfully to the stake, submitted, declaring thus: 
“I implore my God to witness that I have made no crime.” 
Nor was he forsaken of courage, but the death was horrible,   
The sack of gunpowder failing to ignite. 
His legs were blistered sticks on which the black sap   
Bubbled and burst as he howled for the Kindly Light. 
And that was but one, and by no means one of the worst;   
Permitted at least his pitiful dignity; 
And such as were by made prayers in the name of Christ,   
That shall judge all men, for his soul’s tranquillity. 
We move now to outside a German wood.   
Three men are there commanded to dig a hole   
In which the two Jews are ordered to lie down   
And be buried alive by the third, who is a Pole. 
Not light from the shrine at Weimar beyond the hill   
Nor light from heaven appeared. But he did refuse.   
A Lüger settled back deeply in its glove. 
He was ordered to change places with the Jews. 
Much casual death had drained away their souls.   
The thick dirt mounted toward the quivering chin.   
When only the head was exposed the order came   
To dig him out again and to get back in. 
No light, no light in the blue Polish eye. 
When he finished a riding boot packed down the earth.   
The Lüger hovered lightly in its glove. 
He was shot in the belly and in three hours bled to death. 
No prayers or incense rose up in those hours 
Which grew to be years, and every day came mute   
Ghosts from the ovens, sifting through crisp air,   
And settled upon his eyes in a black soot.</poem_text>

		<title>Beowulf (modern English translation)</title>
		<poem_text>LO, praise of the prowess of people-kings 
of spear-armed Danes, in days long sped, 
we have heard, and what honor the athelings won! 
Oft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes, 
from many a tribe, the mead-bench tore, 
awing the earls. Since erst he lay 
friendless, a foundling, fate repaid him: 
for he waxed under welkin, in wealth he throve, 
till before him the folk, both far and near, 
who house by the whale-path, heard his mandate, 
gave him gifts: a good king he! 
To him an heir was afterward born, 
a son in his halls, whom heaven sent 
to favor the folk, feeling their woe 
that erst they had lacked an earl for leader 
so long a while; the Lord endowed him, 
the Wielder of Wonder, with world’s renown. 
Famed was this Beowulf: far flew the boast of him, 
son of Scyld, in the Scandian lands. 
So becomes it a youth to quit him well 
with his father’s friends, by fee and gift, 
that to aid him, aged, in after days, 
come warriors willing, should war draw nigh, 
liegemen loyal: by lauded deeds 
shall an earl have honor in every clan. 
Forth he fared at the fated moment, 
sturdy Scyld to the shelter of God. 
Then they bore him over to ocean’s billow, 
loving clansmen, as late he charged them, 
while wielded words the winsome Scyld, 
the leader beloved who long had ruled.... 
In the roadstead rocked a ring-dight vessel, 
ice-flecked, outbound, atheling’s barge: 
there laid they down their darling lord 
on the breast of the boat, the breaker-of-rings,    
by the mast the mighty one. Many a treasure 
fetched from far was freighted with him. 
No ship have I known so nobly dight 
with weapons of war and weeds of battle, 
with breastplate and blade: on his bosom lay 
a heaped hoard that hence should go 
far o’er the flood with him floating away. 
No less these loaded the lordly gifts, 
thanes’ huge treasure, than those had done 
who in former time forth had sent him 
sole on the seas, a suckling child. 
High o’er his head they hoist the standard, 
a gold-wove banner; let billows take him, 
gave him to ocean. Grave were their spirits, 
mournful their mood. No man is able 
to say in sooth, no son of the halls, 
no hero ‘neath heaven, — who harbored that freight! 
Now Beowulf bode in the burg of the Scyldings, 
leader beloved, and long he ruled 
in fame with all folk, since his father had gone 
away from the world, till awoke an heir, 
haughty Healfdene, who held through life, 
sage and sturdy, the Scyldings glad. 
Then, one after one, there woke to him, 
to the chieftain of clansmen, children four: 
Heorogar, then Hrothgar, then Halga brave; 
and I heard that — was —’s queen, 
the Heathoscylfing’s helpmate dear. 
To Hrothgar was given such glory of war, 
such honor of combat, that all his kin 
obeyed him gladly till great grew his band 
of youthful comrades. It came in his mind 
to bid his henchmen a hall uprear, 
a master mead-house, mightier far 
than ever was seen by the sons of earth, 
and within it, then, to old and young 
he would all allot that the Lord had sent him, 
save only the land and the lives of his men. 
Wide, I heard, was the work commanded, 
for many a tribe this mid-earth round, 
to fashion the folkstead. It fell, as he ordered, 
in rapid achievement that ready it stood there, 
of halls the noblest: Heorot   he named it 
whose message had might in many a land. 
Not reckless of promise, the rings he dealt, 
treasure at banquet: there towered the hall, 
high, gabled wide, the hot surge waiting 
of furious flame.   Nor far was that day 
when father and son-in-law stood in feud 
for warfare and hatred that woke again.    
With envy and anger an evil spirit 
endured the dole in his dark abode, 
that he heard each day the din of revel 
high in the hall: there harps rang out, 
clear song of the singer. He sang who knew 
tales of the early time of man, 
how the Almighty made the earth, 
fairest fields enfolded by water, 
set, triumphant, sun and moon 
for a light to lighten the land-dwellers, 
and braided bright the breast of earth 
with limbs and leaves, made life for all 
of mortal beings that breathe and move. 
So lived the clansmen in cheer and revel 
a winsome life, till one began 
to fashion evils, that field of hell. 
Grendel this monster grim was called, 
march-riever mighty, in moorland living, 
in fen and fastness; fief of the giants 
the hapless wight a while had kept 
since the Creator his exile doomed. 
On kin of Cain was the killing avenged 
by sovran God for slaughtered Abel. 
Ill fared his feud, and far was he driven, 
for the slaughter’s sake, from sight of men. 
Of Cain awoke all that woful breed, 
Etins   and elves and evil-spirits, 
as well as the giants that warred with God 
weary while: but their wage was paid them! 
WENT he forth to find at fall of night 
that haughty house, and heed wherever 
the Ring-Danes, outrevelled, to rest had gone. 
Found within it the atheling band 
asleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow, 
of human hardship. Unhallowed wight, 
grim and greedy, he grasped betimes, 
wrathful, reckless, from resting-places, 
thirty of the thanes, and thence he rushed 
fain of his fell spoil, faring homeward, 
laden with slaughter, his lair to seek. 
Then at the dawning, as day was breaking, 
the might of Grendel to men was known; 
then after wassail was wail uplifted, 
loud moan in the morn. The mighty chief, 
atheling excellent, unblithe sat, 
labored in woe for the loss of his thanes, 
when once had been traced the trail of the fiend, 
spirit accurst: too cruel that sorrow, 
too long, too loathsome. Not late the respite; 
with night returning, anew began 
ruthless murder; he recked no whit, 
firm in his guilt, of the feud and crime. 
They were easy to find who elsewhere sought 
in room remote their rest at night, 
bed in the bowers,   when that bale was shown, 
was seen in sooth, with surest token, — 
the hall-thane’s   hate. Such held themselves 
far and fast who the fiend outran! 
Thus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill 
one against all; until empty stood 
that lordly building, and long it bode so. 
Twelve years’ tide the trouble he bore, 
sovran of Scyldings, sorrows in plenty, 
boundless cares. There came unhidden 
tidings true to the tribes of men, 
in sorrowful songs, how ceaselessly Grendel 
harassed Hrothgar, what hate he bore him, 
what murder and massacre, many a year, 
feud unfading, — refused consent 
to deal with any of Daneland’s earls, 
make pact of peace, or compound for gold: 
still less did the wise men ween to get 
great fee for the feud from his fiendish hands. 
But the evil one ambushed old and young 
death-shadow dark, and dogged them still, 
lured, or lurked in the livelong night 
of misty moorlands: men may say not 
where the haunts of these Hell-Runes   be. 
Such heaping of horrors the hater of men, 
lonely roamer, wrought unceasing, 
harassings heavy. O’er Heorot he lorded, 
gold-bright hall, in gloomy nights; 
and ne’er could the prince   approach his throne, 
— ‘twas judgment of God, — or have joy in his hall. 
Sore was the sorrow to Scyldings’-friend, 
heart-rending misery. Many nobles 
sat assembled, and searched out counsel 
how it were best for bold-hearted men 
against harassing terror to try their hand. 
Whiles they vowed in their heathen fanes 
altar-offerings, asked with words    
that the slayer-of-souls would succor give them 
for the pain of their people. Their practice this, 
their heathen hope; ‘twas Hell they thought of 
in mood of their mind. Almighty they knew not, 
Doomsman of Deeds and dreadful Lord, 
nor Heaven’s-Helmet heeded they ever, 
Wielder-of-Wonder. — Woe for that man 
who in harm and hatred hales his soul 
to fiery embraces; — nor favor nor change 
awaits he ever. But well for him 
that after death-day may draw to his Lord, 
and friendship find in the Father’s arms! 
THUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene 
with the woe of these days; not wisest men 
assuaged his sorrow; too sore the anguish, 
loathly and long, that lay on his folk, 
most baneful of burdens and bales of the night. 
This heard in his home Hygelac’s thane, 
great among Geats, of Grendel’s doings. 
He was the mightiest man of valor 
in that same day of this our life, 
stalwart and stately. A stout wave-walker 
he bade make ready. Yon battle-king, said he, 
far o’er the swan-road he fain would seek, 
the noble monarch who needed men! 
The prince’s journey by prudent folk 
was little blamed, though they loved him dear; 
they whetted the hero, and hailed good omens. 
And now the bold one from bands of Geats 
comrades chose, the keenest of warriors 
e’er he could find; with fourteen men 
the sea-wood   he sought, and, sailor proved, 
led them on to the land’s confines. 
Time had now flown;   afloat was the ship, 
boat under bluff. On board they climbed, 
warriors ready; waves were churning 
sea with sand; the sailors bore 
on the breast of the bark their bright array, 
their mail and weapons: the men pushed off, 
on its willing way, the well-braced craft. 
Then moved o’er the waters by might of the wind 
that bark like a bird with breast of foam, 
till in season due, on the second day, 
the curved prow such course had run 
that sailors now could see the land, 
sea-cliffs shining, steep high hills, 
headlands broad. Their haven was found, 
their journey ended. Up then quickly 
the Weders’   clansmen climbed ashore, 
anchored their sea-wood, with armor clashing 
and gear of battle: God they thanked 
for passing in peace o’er the paths of the sea. 
Now saw from the cliff a Scylding clansman, 
a warden that watched the water-side, 
how they bore o’er the gangway glittering shields, 
war-gear in readiness; wonder seized him 
to know what manner of men they were. 
Straight to the strand his steed he rode, 
Hrothgar’s henchman; with hand of might 
he shook his spear, and spake in parley. 
“Who are ye, then, ye armed men, 
mailed folk, that yon mighty vessel 
have urged thus over the ocean ways, 
here o’er the waters? A warden I, 
sentinel set o’er the sea-march here, 
lest any foe to the folk of Danes 
with harrying fleet should harm the land. 
No aliens ever at ease thus bore them, 
linden-wielders:   yet word-of-leave 
clearly ye lack from clansmen here, 
my folk’s agreement. — A greater ne’er saw I 
of warriors in world than is one of you, —   
yon hero in harness! No henchman he 
worthied by weapons, if witness his features, 
his peerless presence! I pray you, though, tell 
your folk and home, lest hence ye fare 
suspect to wander your way as spies 
in Danish land. Now, dwellers afar, 
ocean-travellers, take from me 
simple advice: the sooner the better 
I hear of the country whence ye came.” 
To him the stateliest spake in answer; 
the warriors’ leader his word-hoard unlocked:— 
“We are by kin of the clan of Geats, 
and Hygelac’s own hearth-fellows we. 
To folk afar was my father known, 
noble atheling, Ecgtheow named. 
Full of winters, he fared away 
aged from earth; he is honored still 
through width of the world by wise men all. 
To thy lord and liege in loyal mood 
we hasten hither, to Healfdene’s son, 
people-protector: be pleased to advise us! 
To that mighty-one come we on mickle errand, 
to the lord of the Danes; nor deem I right 
that aught be hidden. We hear — thou knowest 
if sooth it is — the saying of men, 
that amid the Scyldings a scathing monster, 
dark ill-doer, in dusky nights 
shows terrific his rage unmatched, 
hatred and murder. To Hrothgar I 
in greatness of soul would succor bring, 
so the Wise-and-Brave   may worst his foes, — 
if ever the end of ills is fated, 
of cruel contest, if cure shall follow, 
and the boiling care-waves cooler grow; 
else ever afterward anguish-days 
he shall suffer in sorrow while stands in place 
high on its hill that house unpeered!” 
Astride his steed, the strand-ward answered, 
clansman unquailing: “The keen-souled thane 
must be skilled to sever and sunder duly 
words and works, if he well intends. 
I gather, this band is graciously bent 
to the Scyldings’ master. March, then, bearing 
weapons and weeds the way I show you. 
I will bid my men your boat meanwhile 
to guard for fear lest foemen come, — 
your new-tarred ship by shore of ocean 
faithfully watching till once again 
it waft o’er the waters those well-loved thanes, 
— winding-neck’d wood, — to Weders’ bounds, 
heroes such as the hest of fate 
shall succor and save from the shock of war.” 
They bent them to march, — the boat lay still, 
fettered by cable and fast at anchor, 
broad-bosomed ship. — Then shone the boars    
over the cheek-guard; chased with gold, 
keen and gleaming, guard it kept 
o’er the man of war, as marched along 
heroes in haste, till the hall they saw, 
broad of gable and bright with gold: 
that was the fairest, ‘mid folk of earth, 
of houses ‘neath heaven, where Hrothgar lived, 
and the gleam of it lightened o’er lands afar. 
The sturdy shieldsman showed that bright 
burg-of-the-boldest; bade them go 
straightway thither; his steed then turned, 
hardy hero, and hailed them thus:— 
“Tis time that I fare from you. Father Almighty 
in grace and mercy guard you well, 
safe in your seekings. Seaward I go, 
‘gainst hostile warriors hold my watch.” 
STONE-BRIGHT the street:   it showed the way 
to the crowd of clansmen. Corselets glistened 
hand-forged, hard; on their harness bright 
the steel ring sang, as they strode along 
in mail of battle, and marched to the hall. 
There, weary of ocean, the wall along 
they set their bucklers, their broad shields, down, 
and bowed them to bench: the breastplates clanged, 
war-gear of men; their weapons stacked, 
spears of the seafarers stood together, 
gray-tipped ash: that iron band 
was worthily weaponed! — A warrior proud 
asked of the heroes their home and kin. 
“Whence, now, bear ye burnished shields, 
harness gray and helmets grim, 
spears in multitude? Messenger, I, 
Hrothgar’s herald! Heroes so many 
ne’er met I as strangers of mood so strong. 
‘Tis plain that for prowess, not plunged into exile, 
for high-hearted valor, Hrothgar ye seek!” 
Him the sturdy-in-war bespake with words, 
proud earl of the Weders answer made, 
hardy ‘neath helmet:—”Hygelac’s, we, 
fellows at board; I am Beowulf named. 
I am seeking to say to the son of Healfdene 
this mission of mine, to thy master-lord, 
the doughty prince, if he deign at all 
grace that we greet him, the good one, now.” 
Wulfgar spake, the Wendles’ chieftain, 
whose might of mind to many was known, 
his courage and counsel: “The king of Danes, 
the Scyldings’ friend, I fain will tell, 
the Breaker-of-Rings, as the boon thou askest, 
the famed prince, of thy faring hither, 
and, swiftly after, such answer bring 
as the doughty monarch may deign to give.” 
Hied then in haste to where Hrothgar sat 
white-haired and old, his earls about him, 
till the stout thane stood at the shoulder there 
of the Danish king: good courtier he! 
Wulfgar spake to his winsome lord:— 
“Hither have fared to thee far-come men 
o’er the paths of ocean, people of Geatland; 
and the stateliest there by his sturdy band 
is Beowulf named. This boon they seek, 
that they, my master, may with thee 
have speech at will: nor spurn their prayer 
to give them hearing, gracious Hrothgar! 
In weeds of the warrior worthy they, 
methinks, of our liking; their leader most surely, 
a hero that hither his henchmen has led.” 
HROTHGAR answered, helmet of Scyldings:— 
“I knew him of yore in his youthful days; 
his aged father was Ecgtheow named, 
to whom, at home, gave Hrethel the Geat 
his only daughter. Their offspring bold 
fares hither to seek the steadfast friend. 
And seamen, too, have said me this, — 
who carried my gifts to the Geatish court, 
thither for thanks, — he has thirty men’s 
heft of grasp in the gripe of his hand, 
the bold-in-battle. Blessed God 
out of his mercy this man hath sent 
to Danes of the West, as I ween indeed, 
against horror of Grendel. I hope to give 
the good youth gold for his gallant thought. 
Be thou in haste, and bid them hither, 
clan of kinsmen, to come before me; 
and add this word, — they are welcome guests 
to folk of the Danes.” [To the door of the hall 
Wulfgar went] and the word declared:— 
“To you this message my master sends, 
East-Danes’ king, that your kin he knows, 
hardy heroes, and hails you all 
welcome hither o’er waves of the sea! 
Ye may wend your way in war-attire, 
and under helmets Hrothgar greet; 
but let here the battle-shields bide your parley, 
and wooden war-shafts wait its end.” 
Uprose the mighty one, ringed with his men, 
brave band of thanes: some bode without, 
battle-gear guarding, as bade the chief. 
Then hied that troop where the herald led them, 
under Heorot’s roof: [the hero strode,] 
hardy ‘neath helm, till the hearth he neared. 
Beowulf spake, — his breastplate gleamed, 
war-net woven by wit of the smith:— 
“Thou Hrothgar, hail! Hygelac’s I, 
kinsman and follower. Fame a plenty 
have I gained in youth! These Grendel-deeds 
I heard in my home-land heralded clear. 
Seafarers say how stands this hall, 
of buildings best, for your band of thanes 
empty and idle, when evening sun 
in the harbor of heaven is hidden away. 
So my vassals advised me well, — 
brave and wise, the best of men, — 
O sovran Hrothgar, to seek thee here, 
for my nerve and my might they knew full well. 
Themselves had seen me from slaughter come 
blood-flecked from foes, where five I bound, 
and that wild brood worsted. I’ the waves I slew 
nicors   by night, in need and peril 
avenging the Weders,   whose woe they sought, — 
crushing the grim ones. Grendel now, 
monster cruel, be mine to quell 
in single battle! So, from thee, 
thou sovran of the Shining-Danes, 
Scyldings’-bulwark, a boon I seek, — 
and, Friend-of-the-folk, refuse it not, 
O Warriors’-shield, now I’ve wandered far, — 
that I alone with my liegemen here, 
this hardy band, may Heorot purge! 
More I hear, that the monster dire, 
in his wanton mood, of weapons recks not; 
hence shall I scorn — so Hygelac stay, 
king of my kindred, kind to me! — 
brand or buckler to bear in the fight, 
gold-colored targe: but with gripe alone 
must I front the fiend and fight for life, 
foe against foe. Then faith be his 
in the doom of the Lord whom death shall take. 
Fain, I ween, if the fight he win, 
in this hall of gold my Geatish band 
will he fearless eat, — as oft before, — 
my noblest thanes. Nor need’st thou then 
to hide my head;   for his shall I be, 
dyed in gore, if death must take me; 
and my blood-covered body he’ll bear as prey, 
ruthless devour it, the roamer-lonely, 
with my life-blood redden his lair in the fen: 
no further for me need’st food prepare! 
To Hygelac send, if Hild   should take me, 
best of war-weeds, warding my breast, 
armor excellent, heirloom of Hrethel 
and work of Wayland.   Fares Wyrd   as she must.” 
HROTHGAR spake, the Scyldings’-helmet:— 
“For fight defensive, Friend my Beowulf, 
to succor and save, thou hast sought us here. 
Thy father’s combat   a feud enkindled 
when Heatholaf with hand he slew 
among the Wylfings; his Weder kin 
for horror of fighting feared to hold him. 
Fleeing, he sought our South-Dane folk, 
over surge of ocean the Honor-Scyldings, 
when first I was ruling the folk of Danes, 
wielded, youthful, this widespread realm, 
this hoard-hold of heroes. Heorogar was dead, 
my elder brother, had breathed his last, 
Healfdene’s bairn: he was better than I! 
Straightway the feud with fee   I settled, 
to the Wylfings sent, o’er watery ridges, 
treasures olden: oaths he   swore me. 
Sore is my soul to say to any 
of the race of man what ruth for me 
in Heorot Grendel with hate hath wrought, 
what sudden harryings. Hall-folk fail me, 
my warriors wane; for Wyrd hath swept them 
into Grendel’s grasp. But God is able 
this deadly foe from his deeds to turn! 
Boasted full oft, as my beer they drank, 
earls o’er the ale-cup, armed men, 
that they would bide in the beer-hall here, 
Grendel’s attack with terror of blades. 
Then was this mead-house at morning tide 
dyed with gore, when the daylight broke, 
all the boards of the benches blood-besprinkled, 
gory the hall: I had heroes the less, 
doughty dear-ones that death had reft. 
— But sit to the banquet, unbind thy words, 
hardy hero, as heart shall prompt thee.” 
Gathered together, the Geatish men 
in the banquet-hall on bench assigned, 
sturdy-spirited, sat them down, 
hardy-hearted. A henchman attended, 
carried the carven cup in hand, 
served the clear mead. Oft minstrels sang 
blithe in Heorot. Heroes revelled, 
no dearth of warriors, Weder and Dane. 
UNFERTH spake, the son of Ecglaf, 
who sat at the feet of the Scyldings’ lord, 
unbound the battle-runes.   — Beowulf’s quest, 
sturdy seafarer’s, sorely galled him; 
ever he envied that other men 
should more achieve in middle-earth 
of fame under heaven than he himself. — 
“Art thou that Beowulf, Breca’s rival, 
who emulous swam on the open sea, 
when for pride the pair of you proved the floods, 
and wantonly dared in waters deep 
to risk your lives? No living man, 
or lief or loath, from your labor dire 
could you dissuade, from swimming the main. 
Ocean-tides with your arms ye covered, 
with strenuous hands the sea-streets measured, 
swam o’er the waters. Winter’s storm 
rolled the rough waves. In realm of sea 
a sennight strove ye. In swimming he topped thee, 
had more of main! Him at morning-tide 
billows bore to the Battling Reamas, 
whence he hied to his home so dear 
beloved of his liegemen, to land of Brondings, 
fastness fair, where his folk he ruled, 
town and treasure. In triumph o’er thee 
Beanstan’s bairn   his boast achieved. 
So ween I for thee a worse adventure 
— though in buffet of battle thou brave hast been, 
in struggle grim, — if Grendel’s approach 
thou darst await through the watch of night!” 
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:— 
“What a deal hast uttered, dear my Unferth, 
drunken with beer, of Breca now, 
told of his triumph! Truth I claim it, 
that I had more of might in the sea 
than any man else, more ocean-endurance. 
We twain had talked, in time of youth, 
and made our boast, — we were merely boys, 
striplings still, — to stake our lives 
far at sea: and so we performed it. 
Naked swords, as we swam along, 
we held in hand, with hope to guard us 
against the whales. Not a whit from me 
could he float afar o’er the flood of waves, 
haste o’er the billows; nor him I abandoned. 
Together we twain on the tides abode 
five nights full till the flood divided us, 
churning waves and chillest weather, 
darkling night, and the northern wind 
ruthless rushed on us: rough was the surge. 
Now the wrath of the sea-fish rose apace; 
yet me ‘gainst the monsters my mailed coat, 
hard and hand-linked, help afforded, — 
battle-sark braided my breast to ward, 
garnished with gold. There grasped me firm 
and haled me to bottom the hated foe, 
with grimmest gripe. ‘Twas granted me, though, 
to pierce the monster with point of sword, 
with blade of battle: huge beast of the sea 
was whelmed by the hurly through hand of mine. 
ME thus often the evil monsters 
thronging threatened. With thrust of my sword, 
the darling, I dealt them due return! 
Nowise had they bliss from their booty then 
to devour their victim, vengeful creatures, 
seated to banquet at bottom of sea; 
but at break of day, by my brand sore hurt, 
on the edge of ocean up they lay, 
put to sleep by the sword. And since, by them 
on the fathomless sea-ways sailor-folk 
are never molested. — Light from east, 
came bright God’s beacon; the billows sank, 
so that I saw the sea-cliffs high, 
windy walls. For Wyrd oft saveth 
earl undoomed if he doughty be! 
And so it came that I killed with my sword 
nine of the nicors. Of night-fought battles 
ne’er heard I a harder ‘neath heaven’s dome, 
nor adrift on the deep a more desolate man! 
Yet I came unharmed from that hostile clutch, 
though spent with swimming. The sea upbore me, 
flood of the tide, on Finnish land, 
the welling waters. No wise of thee 
have I heard men tell such terror of falchions, 
bitter battle. Breca ne’er yet, 
not one of you pair, in the play of war 
such daring deed has done at all 
with bloody brand, — I boast not of it! — 
though thou wast the bane   of thy brethren dear, 
thy closest kin, whence curse of hell 
awaits thee, well as thy wit may serve! 
For I say in sooth, thou son of Ecglaf, 
never had Grendel these grim deeds wrought, 
monster dire, on thy master dear, 
in Heorot such havoc, if heart of thine 
were as battle-bold as thy boast is loud! 
But he has found no feud will happen; 
from sword-clash dread of your Danish clan 
he vaunts him safe, from the Victor-Scyldings. 
He forces pledges, favors none 
of the land of Danes, but lustily murders, 
fights and feasts, nor feud he dreads 
from Spear-Dane men. But speedily now 
shall I prove him the prowess and pride of the Geats, 
shall bid him battle. Blithe to mead 
go he that listeth, when light of dawn 
this morrow morning o’er men of earth, 
ether-robed sun from the south shall beam!” 
Joyous then was the Jewel-giver, 
hoar-haired, war-brave; help awaited 
the Bright-Danes’ prince, from Beowulf hearing, 
folk’s good shepherd, such firm resolve. 
Then was laughter of liegemen loud resounding 
with winsome words. Came Wealhtheow forth, 
queen of Hrothgar, heedful of courtesy, 
gold-decked, greeting the guests in hall; 
and the high-born lady handed the cup 
first to the East-Danes’ heir and warden, 
bade him be blithe at the beer-carouse, 
the land’s beloved one. Lustily took he 
banquet and beaker, battle-famed king. 
Through the hall then went the Helmings’ Lady, 
to younger and older everywhere 
carried the cup, till come the moment 
when the ring-graced queen, the royal-hearted, 
to Beowulf bore the beaker of mead. 
She greeted the Geats’ lord, God she thanked, 
in wisdom’s words, that her will was granted, 
that at last on a hero her hope could lean 
for comfort in terrors. The cup he took, 
hardy-in-war, from Wealhtheow’s hand, 
and answer uttered the eager-for-combat. 
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:— 
“This was my thought, when my thanes and I 
bent to the ocean and entered our boat, 
that I would work the will of your people 
fully, or fighting fall in death, 
in fiend’s gripe fast. I am firm to do 
an earl’s brave deed, or end the days 
of this life of mine in the mead-hall here.” 
Well these words to the woman seemed, 
Beowulf’s battle-boast. — Bright with gold 
the stately dame by her spouse sat down. 
Again, as erst, began in hall 
warriors’ wassail and words of power, 
the proud-band’s revel, till presently 
the son of Healfdene hastened to seek 
rest for the night; he knew there waited 
fight for the fiend in that festal hall, 
when the sheen of the sun they saw no more, 
and dusk of night sank darkling nigh, 
and shadowy shapes came striding on, 
wan under welkin. The warriors rose. 
Man to man, he made harangue, 
Hrothgar to Beowulf, bade him hail, 
let him wield the wine hall: a word he added:— 
“Never to any man erst I trusted, 
since I could heave up hand and shield, 
this noble Dane-Hall, till now to thee. 
Have now and hold this house unpeered; 
remember thy glory; thy might declare; 
watch for the foe! No wish shall fail thee 
if thou bidest the battle with bold-won life.” 
THEN Hrothgar went with his hero-train, 
defence-of-Scyldings, forth from hall; 
fain would the war-lord Wealhtheow seek, 
couch of his queen. The King-of-Glory 
against this Grendel a guard had set, 
so heroes heard, a hall-defender, 
who warded the monarch and watched for the monster. 
In truth, the Geats’ prince gladly trusted 
his mettle, his might, the mercy of God! 
Cast off then his corselet of iron, 
helmet from head; to his henchman gave, — 
choicest of weapons, — the well-chased sword, 
bidding him guard the gear of battle. 
Spake then his Vaunt the valiant man, 
Beowulf Geat, ere the bed be sought:— 
“Of force in fight no feebler I count me, 
in grim war-deeds, than Grendel deems him. 
Not with the sword, then, to sleep of death 
his life will I give, though it lie in my power. 
No skill is his to strike against me, 
my shield to hew though he hardy be, 
bold in battle; we both, this night, 
shall spurn the sword, if he seek me here, 
unweaponed, for war. Let wisest God, 
sacred Lord, on which side soever 
doom decree as he deemeth right.” 
Reclined then the chieftain, and cheek-pillows held 
the head of the earl, while all about him 
seamen hardy on hall-beds sank. 
None of them thought that thence their steps 
to the folk and fastness that fostered them, 
to the land they loved, would lead them back! 
Full well they wist that on warriors many 
battle-death seized, in the banquet-hall, 
of Danish clan. But comfort and help, 
war-weal weaving, to Weder folk 
the Master gave, that, by might of one, 
over their enemy all prevailed, 
by single strength. In sooth ‘tis told 
that highest God o’er human kind 
hath wielded ever! — Thro’ wan night striding, 
came the walker-in-shadow. Warriors slept 
whose hest was to guard the gabled hall, — 
all save one. ‘Twas widely known 
that against God’s will the ghostly ravager 
him   could not hurl to haunts of darkness; 
wakeful, ready, with warrior’s wrath, 
bold he bided the battle’s issue. 
THEN from the moorland, by misty crags, 
with God’s wrath laden, Grendel came. 
The monster was minded of mankind now 
sundry to seize in the stately house. 
Under welkin he walked, till the wine-palace there, 
gold-hall of men, he gladly discerned, 
flashing with fretwork. Not first time, this, 
that he the home of Hrothgar sought, — 
yet ne’er in his life-day, late or early, 
such hardy heroes, such hall-thanes, found! 
To the house the warrior walked apace, 
parted from peace;   the portal opended, 
though with forged bolts fast, when his fists had struck it, 
and baleful he burst in his blatant rage, 
the house’s mouth. All hastily, then, 
o’er fair-paved floor the fiend trod on, 
ireful he strode; there streamed from his eyes 
fearful flashes, like flame to see. 
He spied in hall the hero-band, 
kin and clansmen clustered asleep, 
hardy liegemen. Then laughed his heart; 
for the monster was minded, ere morn should dawn, 
savage, to sever the soul of each, 
life from body, since lusty banquet 
waited his will! But Wyrd forbade him 
to seize any more of men on earth 
after that evening. Eagerly watched 
Hygelac’s kinsman his cursed foe, 
how he would fare in fell attack. 
Not that the monster was minded to pause! 
Straightway he seized a sleeping warrior 
for the first, and tore him fiercely asunder, 
the bone-frame bit, drank blood in streams, 
swallowed him piecemeal: swiftly thus 
the lifeless corse was clear devoured, 
e’en feet and hands. Then farther he hied; 
for the hardy hero with hand he grasped, 
felt for the foe with fiendish claw, 
for the hero reclining, — who clutched it boldly, 
prompt to answer, propped on his arm. 
Soon then saw that shepherd-of-evils 
that never he met in this middle-world, 
in the ways of earth, another wight 
with heavier hand-gripe; at heart he feared, 
sorrowed in soul, — none the sooner escaped! 
Fain would he flee, his fastness seek, 
the den of devils: no doings now 
such as oft he had done in days of old! 
Then bethought him the hardy Hygelac-thane 
of his boast at evening: up he bounded, 
grasped firm his foe, whose fingers cracked. 
The fiend made off, but the earl close followed. 
The monster meant — if he might at all — 
to fling himself free, and far away 
fly to the fens, — knew his fingers’ power 
in the gripe of the grim one. Gruesome march 
to Heorot this monster of harm had made! 
Din filled the room; the Danes were bereft, 
castle-dwellers and clansmen all, 
earls, of their ale. Angry were both 
those savage hall-guards: the house resounded. 
Wonder it was the wine-hall firm 
in the strain of their struggle stood, to earth 
the fair house fell not; too fast it was 
within and without by its iron bands 
craftily clamped; though there crashed from sill 
many a mead-bench — men have told me — 
gay with gold, where the grim foes wrestled. 
So well had weened the wisest Scyldings 
that not ever at all might any man 
that bone-decked, brave house break asunder, 
crush by craft, — unless clasp of fire 
in smoke engulfed it. — Again uprose 
din redoubled. Danes of the North 
with fear and frenzy were filled, each one, 
who from the wall that wailing heard, 
God’s foe sounding his grisly song, 
cry of the conquered, clamorous pain 
from captive of hell. Too closely held him 
he who of men in might was strongest 
in that same day of this our life. 
NOT in any wise would the earls’-defence    
suffer that slaughterous stranger to live, 
useless deeming his days and years 
to men on earth. Now many an earl 
of Beowulf brandished blade ancestral, 
fain the life of their lord to shield, 
their praised prince, if power were theirs; 
never they knew, — as they neared the foe, 
hardy-hearted heroes of war, 
aiming their swords on every side 
the accursed to kill, — no keenest blade, 
no farest of falchions fashioned on earth, 
could harm or hurt that hideous fiend! 
He was safe, by his spells, from sword of battle, 
from edge of iron. Yet his end and parting 
on that same day of this our life 
woful should be, and his wandering soul 
far off flit to the fiends’ domain. 
Soon he found, who in former days, 
harmful in heart and hated of God, 
on many a man such murder wrought, 
that the frame of his body failed him now. 
For him the keen-souled kinsman of Hygelac 
held in hand; hateful alive 
was each to other. The outlaw dire 
took mortal hurt; a mighty wound 
showed on his shoulder, and sinews cracked, 
and the bone-frame burst. To Beowulf now 
the glory was given, and Grendel thence 
death-sick his den in the dark moor sought, 
noisome abode: he knew too well 
that here was the last of life, an end 
of his days on earth. — To all the Danes 
by that bloody battle the boon had come. 
From ravage had rescued the roving stranger 
Hrothgar’s hall; the hardy and wise one 
had purged it anew. His night-work pleased him, 
his deed and its honor. To Eastern Danes 
had the valiant Geat his vaunt made good, 
all their sorrow and ills assuaged, 
their bale of battle borne so long, 
and all the dole they erst endured 
pain a-plenty. — ‘Twas proof of this, 
when the hardy-in-fight a hand laid down, 
arm and shoulder, — all, indeed, 
of Grendel’s gripe, — ‘neath the gabled roof’ 
MANY at morning, as men have told me, 
warriors gathered the gift-hall round, 
folk-leaders faring from far and near, 
o’er wide-stretched ways, the wonder to view, 
trace of the traitor. Not troublous seemed 
the enemy’s end to any man 
who saw by the gait of the graceless foe 
how the weary-hearted, away from thence, 
baffled in battle and banned, his steps 
death-marked dragged to the devils’ mere. 
Bloody the billows were boiling there, 
turbid the tide of tumbling waves 
horribly seething, with sword-blood hot, 
by that doomed one dyed, who in den of the moor 
laid forlorn his life adown, 
his heathen soul,-and hell received it. 
Home then rode the hoary clansmen 
from that merry journey, and many a youth, 
on horses white, the hardy warriors, 
back from the mere. Then Beowulf’s glory 
eager they echoed, and all averred 
that from sea to sea, or south or north, 
there was no other in earth’s domain, 
under vault of heaven, more valiant found, 
of warriors none more worthy to rule! 
(On their lord beloved they laid no slight, 
gracious Hrothgar: a good king he!) 
From time to time, the tried-in-battle 
their gray steeds set to gallop amain, 
and ran a race when the road seemed fair. 
From time to time, a thane of the king, 
who had made many vaunts, and was mindful of verses, 
stored with sagas and songs of old, 
bound word to word in well-knit rime, 
welded his lay; this warrior soon 
of Beowulf’s quest right cleverly sang, 
and artfully added an excellent tale, 
in well-ranged words, of the warlike deeds 
he had heard in saga of Sigemund. 
Strange the story: he said it all, — 
the Waelsing’s wanderings wide, his struggles, 
which never were told to tribes of men, 
the feuds and the frauds, save to Fitela only, 
when of these doings he deigned to speak, 
uncle to nephew; as ever the twain 
stood side by side in stress of war, 
and multitude of the monster kind 
they had felled with their swords. Of Sigemund grew, 
when he passed from life, no little praise; 
for the doughty-in-combat a dragon killed 
that herded the hoard:   under hoary rock 
the atheling dared the deed alone 
fearful quest, nor was Fitela there. 
Yet so it befell, his falchion pierced 
that wondrous worm, — on the wall it struck, 
best blade; the dragon died in its blood. 
Thus had the dread-one by daring achieved 
over the ring-hoard to rule at will, 
himself to pleasure; a sea-boat he loaded, 
and bore on its bosom the beaming gold, 
son of Waels; the worm was consumed. 
He had of all heroes the highest renown 
among races of men, this refuge-of-warriors, 
for deeds of daring that decked his name 
since the hand and heart of Heremod 
grew slack in battle. He, swiftly banished 
to mingle with monsters at mercy of foes, 
to death was betrayed; for torrents of sorrow 
had lamed him too long; a load of care 
to earls and athelings all he proved. 
Oft indeed, in earlier days, 
for the warrior’s wayfaring wise men mourned, 
who had hoped of him help from harm and bale, 
and had thought their sovran’s son would thrive, 
follow his father, his folk protect, 
the hoard and the stronghold, heroes’ land, 
home of Scyldings. — But here, thanes said, 
the kinsman of Hygelac kinder seemed 
to all: the other   was urged to crime! 
And afresh to the race,   the fallow roads 
by swift steeds measured! The morning sun 
was climbing higher. Clansmen hastened 
to the high-built hall, those hardy-minded, 
the wonder to witness. Warden of treasure, 
crowned with glory, the king himself, 
with stately band from the bride-bower strode; 
and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens 
measured the path to the mead-house fair. 
HROTHGAR spake, — to the hall he went, 
stood by the steps, the steep roof saw, 
garnished with gold, and Grendel’s hand:— 
“For the sight I see to the Sovran Ruler 
be speedy thanks! A throng of sorrows 
I have borne from Grendel; but God still works 
wonder on wonder, the Warden-of-Glory. 
It was but now that I never more 
for woes that weighed on me waited help 
long as I lived, when, laved in blood, 
stood sword-gore-stained this stateliest house, — 
widespread woe for wise men all, 
who had no hope to hinder ever 
foes infernal and fiendish sprites 
from havoc in hall. This hero now, 
by the Wielder’s might, a work has done 
that not all of us erst could ever do 
by wile and wisdom. Lo, well can she say 
whoso of women this warrior bore 
among sons of men, if still she liveth, 
that the God of the ages was good to her 
in the birth of her bairn. Now, Beowulf, thee, 
of heroes best, I shall heartily love 
as mine own, my son; preserve thou ever 
this kinship new: thou shalt never lack 
wealth of the world that I wield as mine! 
Full oft for less have I largess showered, 
my precious hoard, on a punier man, 
less stout in struggle. Thyself hast now 
fulfilled such deeds, that thy fame shall endure 
through all the ages. As ever he did, 
well may the Wielder reward thee still!” 
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:— 
“This work of war most willingly 
we have fought, this fight, and fearlessly dared 
force of the foe. Fain, too, were I 
hadst thou but seen himself, what time 
the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall! 
Swiftly, I thought, in strongest gripe 
on his bed of death to bind him down, 
that he in the hent of this hand of mine 
should breathe his last: but he broke away. 
Him I might not — the Maker willed not — 
hinder from flight, and firm enough hold 
the life-destroyer: too sturdy was he, 
the ruthless, in running! For rescue, however, 
he left behind him his hand in pledge, 
arm and shoulder; nor aught of help 
could the cursed one thus procure at all. 
None the longer liveth he, loathsome fiend, 
sunk in his sins, but sorrow holds him 
tightly grasped in gripe of anguish, 
in baleful bonds, where bide he must, 
evil outlaw, such awful doom 
as the Mighty Maker shall mete him out.” 
More silent seemed the son of Ecglaf    
in boastful speech of his battle-deeds, 
since athelings all, through the earl’s great prowess, 
beheld that hand, on the high roof gazing, 
foeman’s fingers, — the forepart of each 
of the sturdy nails to steel was likest, — 
heathen’s “hand-spear,” hostile warrior’s 
claw uncanny. ‘Twas clear, they said, 
that him no blade of the brave could touch, 
how keen soever, or cut away 
that battle-hand bloody from baneful foe. 
THERE was hurry and hest in Heorot now 
for hands to bedeck it, and dense was the throng 
of men and women the wine-hall to cleanse, 
the guest-room to garnish. Gold-gay shone the hangings 
that were wove on the wall, and wonders many 
to delight each mortal that looks upon them. 
Though braced within by iron bands, 
that building bright was broken sorely;    
rent were its hinges; the roof alone 
held safe and sound, when, seared with crime, 
the fiendish foe his flight essayed, 
of life despairing. — No light thing that, 
the flight for safety, — essay it who will! 
Forced of fate, he shall find his way 
to the refuge ready for race of man, 
for soul-possessors, and sons of earth; 
and there his body on bed of death 
shall rest after revel. Arrived was the hour 
when to hall proceeded Healfdene’s son: 
the king himself would sit to banquet. 
Ne’er heard I of host in haughtier throng 
more graciously gathered round giver-of-rings! 
Bowed then to bench those bearers-of-glory, 
fain of the feasting. Featly received 
many a mead-cup the mighty-in-spirit, 
kinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall, 
Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot now 
was filled with friends; the folk of Scyldings 
ne’er yet had tried the traitor’s deed. 
To Beowulf gave the bairn of Healfdene 
a gold-wove banner, guerdon of triumph, 
broidered battle-flag, breastplate and helmet; 
and a splendid sword was seen of many 
borne to the brave one. Beowulf took 
cup in hall:   for such costly gifts 
he suffered no shame in that soldier throng. 
For I heard of few heroes, in heartier mood, 
with four such gifts, so fashioned with gold, 
on the ale-bench honoring others thus! 
O’er the roof of the helmet high, a ridge, 
wound with wires, kept ward o’er the head, 
lest the relict-of-files   should fierce invade, 
sharp in the strife, when that shielded hero 
should go to grapple against his foes. 
Then the earls’-defence   on the floor   bade lead 
coursers eight, with carven head-gear, 
adown the hall: one horse was decked 
with a saddle all shining and set in jewels; 
‘twas the battle-seat of the best of kings, 
when to play of swords the son of Healfdene 
was fain to fare. Ne’er failed his valor 
in the crush of combat when corpses fell. 
To Beowulf over them both then gave 
the refuge-of-Ingwines right and power, 
o’er war-steeds and weapons: wished him joy of them. 
Manfully thus the mighty prince, 
hoard-guard for heroes, that hard fight repaid 
with steeds and treasures contemned by none 
who is willing to say the sooth aright. 
AND the lord of earls, to each that came 
with Beowulf over the briny ways, 
an heirloom there at the ale-bench gave, 
precious gift; and the price   bade pay 
in gold for him whom Grendel erst 
murdered, — and fain of them more had killed, 
had not wisest God their Wyrd averted, 
and the man’s   brave mood. The Maker then 
ruled human kind, as here and now. 
Therefore is insight always best, 
and forethought of mind. How much awaits him 
of lief and of loath, who long time here, 
through days of warfare this world endures! 
Then song and music mingled sounds 
in the presence of Healfdene’s head-of-armies    
and harping was heard with the hero-lay 
as Hrothgar’s singer the hall-joy woke 
along the mead-seats, making his song 
of that sudden raid on the sons of Finn.    
Healfdene’s hero, Hnaef the Scylding, 
was fated to fall in the Frisian slaughter.    
Hildeburh needed not hold in value 
her enemies’ honor!   Innocent both 
were the loved ones she lost at the linden-play, 
bairn and brother, they bowed to fate, 
stricken by spears; ‘twas a sorrowful woman! 
None doubted why the daughter of Hoc 
bewailed her doom when dawning came, 
and under the sky she saw them lying, 
kinsmen murdered, where most she had kenned 
of the sweets of the world! By war were swept, too, 
Finn’s own liegemen, and few were left; 
in the parleying-place   he could ply no longer 
weapon, nor war could he wage on Hengest, 
and rescue his remnant by right of arms 
from the prince’s thane. A pact he offered: 
another dwelling the Danes should have, 
hall and high-seat, and half the power 
should fall to them in Frisian land; 
and at the fee-gifts, Folcwald’s son 
day by day the Danes should honor, 
the folk of Hengest favor with rings, 
even as truly, with treasure and jewels, 
with fretted gold, as his Frisian kin 
he meant to honor in ale-hall there. 
Pact of peace they plighted further 
on both sides firmly. Finn to Hengest 
with oath, upon honor, openly promised 
that woful remnant, with wise-men’s aid, 
nobly to govern, so none of the guests 
by word or work should warp the treaty,    
or with malice of mind bemoan themselves 
as forced to follow their fee-giver’s slayer, 
lordless men, as their lot ordained. 
Should Frisian, moreover, with foeman’s taunt, 
that murderous hatred to mind recall, 
then edge of the sword must seal his doom. 
Oaths were given, and ancient gold 
heaped from hoard. — The hardy Scylding, 
battle-thane best,   on his balefire lay. 
All on the pyre were plain to see 
the gory sark, the gilded swine-crest, 
boar of hard iron, and athelings many 
slain by the sword: at the slaughter they fell. 
It was Hildeburh’s hest, at Hnaef’s own pyre 
the bairn of her body on brands to lay, 
his bones to burn, on the balefire placed, 
at his uncle’s side. In sorrowful dirges 
bewept them the woman: great wailing ascended. 
Then wound up to welkin the wildest of death-fires, 
roared o’er the hillock:   heads all were melted, 
gashes burst, and blood gushed out 
from bites   of the body. Balefire devoured, 
greediest spirit, those spared not by war 
out of either folk: their flower was gone. 
THEN hastened those heroes their home to see, 
friendless, to find the Frisian land, 
houses and high burg. Hengest still 
through the death-dyed winter dwelt with Finn, 
holding pact, yet of home he minded, 
though powerless his ring-decked prow to drive 
over the waters, now waves rolled fierce 
lashed by the winds, or winter locked them 
in icy fetters. Then fared another 
year to men’s dwellings, as yet they do, 
the sunbright skies, that their season ever 
duly await. Far off winter was driven; 
fair lay earth’s breast; and fain was the rover, 
the guest, to depart, though more gladly he pondered 
on wreaking his vengeance than roaming the deep, 
and how to hasten the hot encounter 
where sons of the Frisians were sure to be. 
So he escaped not the common doom, 
when Hun with “Lafing,” the light-of-battle, 
best of blades, his bosom pierced: 
its edge was famed with the Frisian earls. 
On fierce-heart Finn there fell likewise, 
on himself at home, the horrid sword-death; 
for Guthlaf and Oslaf of grim attack 
had sorrowing told, from sea-ways landed, 
mourning their woes.   Finn’s wavering spirit 
bode not in breast. The burg was reddened 
with blood of foemen, and Finn was slain, 
king amid clansmen; the queen was taken. 
To their ship the Scylding warriors bore 
all the chattels the chieftain owned, 
whatever they found in Finn’s domain 
of gems and jewels. The gentle wife 
o’er paths of the deep to the Danes they bore, 
led to her land. The lay was finished, 
the gleeman’s song. Then glad rose the revel; 
bench-joy brightened. Bearers draw 
from their “wonder-vats” wine. Comes Wealhtheow forth, 
under gold-crown goes where the good pair sit, 
uncle and nephew, true each to the other one, 
kindred in amity. Unferth the spokesman 
at the Scylding lord’s feet sat: men had faith in his spirit, 
his keenness of courage, though kinsmen had found him 
unsure at the sword-play. The Scylding queen spoke: 
“Quaff of this cup, my king and lord, 
breaker of rings, and blithe be thou, 
gold-friend of men; to the Geats here speak 
such words of mildness as man should use. 
Be glad with thy Geats; of those gifts be mindful, 
or near or far, which now thou hast. 
Men say to me, as son thou wishest 
yon hero to hold. Thy Heorot purged, 
jewel-hall brightest, enjoy while thou canst, 
with many a largess; and leave to thy kin 
folk and realm when forth thou goest 
to greet thy doom. For gracious I deem 
my Hrothulf,   willing to hold and rule 
nobly our youths, if thou yield up first, 
prince of Scyldings, thy part in the world. 
I ween with good he will well requite 
offspring of ours, when all he minds 
that for him we did in his helpless days 
of gift and grace to gain him honor!” 
Then she turned to the seat where her sons were placed, 
Hrethric and Hrothmund, with heroes’ bairns, 
young men together: the Geat, too, sat there, 
Beowulf brave, the brothers between. 
A CUP she gave him, with kindly greeting 
and winsome words. Of wounden gold, 
she offered, to honor him, arm-jewels twain, 
corselet and rings, and of collars the noblest 
that ever I knew the earth around. 
Ne’er heard I so mighty, ‘neath heaven’s dome, 
a hoard-gem of heroes, since Hama bore 
to his bright-built burg the Brisings’ necklace, 
jewel and gem casket. — Jealousy fled he, 
Eormenric’s hate: chose help eternal. 
Hygelac Geat, grandson of Swerting, 
on the last of his raids this ring bore with him, 
under his banner the booty defending, 
the war-spoil warding; but Wyrd o’erwhelmed him 
what time, in his daring, dangers he sought, 
feud with Frisians. Fairest of gems 
he bore with him over the beaker-of-waves, 
sovran strong: under shield he died. 
Fell the corpse of the king into keeping of Franks, 
gear of the breast, and that gorgeous ring; 
weaker warriors won the spoil, 
after gripe of battle, from Geatland’s lord, 
and held the death-field. Din rose in hall. 
Wealhtheow spake amid warriors, and said:— 
“This jewel enjoy in thy jocund youth, 
Beowulf lov’d, these battle-weeds wear, 
a royal treasure, and richly thrive! 
Preserve thy strength, and these striplings here 
counsel in kindness: requital be mine. 
Hast done such deeds, that for days to come 
thou art famed among folk both far and near, 
so wide as washeth the wave of Ocean 
his windy walls. Through the ways of life 
prosper, O prince! I pray for thee 
rich possessions. To son of mine 
be helpful in deed and uphold his joys! 
Here every earl to the other is true, 
mild of mood, to the master loyal! 
Thanes are friendly, the throng obedient, 
liegemen are revelling: list and obey!” 
Went then to her place. — That was proudest of feasts; 
flowed wine for the warriors. Wyrd they knew not, 
destiny dire, and the doom to be seen 
by many an earl when eve should come, 
and Hrothgar homeward hasten away, 
royal, to rest. The room was guarded 
by an army of earls, as erst was done. 
They bared the bench-boards; abroad they spread 
beds and bolsters. — One beer-carouser 
in danger of doom lay down in the hall. — 
At their heads they set their shields of war, 
bucklers bright; on the bench were there 
over each atheling, easy to see, 
the high battle-helmet, the haughty spear, 
the corselet of rings. ‘Twas their custom so 
ever to be for battle prepared, 
at home, or harrying, which it were, 
even as oft as evil threatened 
their sovran king. — They were clansmen good. 
THEN sank they to sleep. With sorrow one bought 
his rest of the evening, — as ofttime had happened 
when Grendel guarded that golden hall, 
evil wrought, till his end drew nigh, 
slaughter for sins. ‘Twas seen and told 
how an avenger survived the fiend, 
as was learned afar. The livelong time 
after that grim fight, Grendel’s mother, 
monster of women, mourned her woe. 
She was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters, 
cold sea-courses, since Cain cut down 
with edge of the sword his only brother, 
his father’s offspring: outlawed he fled, 
marked with murder, from men’s delights 
warded the wilds. — There woke from him 
such fate-sent ghosts as Grendel, who, 
war-wolf horrid, at Heorot found 
a warrior watching and waiting the fray, 
with whom the grisly one grappled amain. 
But the man remembered his mighty power, 
the glorious gift that God had sent him, 
in his Maker’s mercy put his trust 
for comfort and help: so he conquered the foe, 
felled the fiend, who fled abject, 
reft of joy, to the realms of death, 
mankind’s foe. And his mother now, 
gloomy and grim, would go that quest 
of sorrow, the death of her son to avenge. 
To Heorot came she, where helmeted Danes 
slept in the hall. Too soon came back 
old ills of the earls, when in she burst, 
the mother of Grendel. Less grim, though, that terror, 
e’en as terror of woman in war is less, 
might of maid, than of men in arms 
when, hammer-forged, the falchion hard, 
sword gore-stained, through swine of the helm, 
crested, with keen blade carves amain. 
Then was in hall the hard-edge drawn, 
the swords on the settles,   and shields a-many 
firm held in hand: nor helmet minded 
nor harness of mail, whom that horror seized. 
Haste was hers; she would hie afar 
and save her life when the liegemen saw her. 
Yet a single atheling up she seized 
fast and firm, as she fled to the moor. 
He was for Hrothgar of heroes the dearest, 
of trusty vassals betwixt the seas, 
whom she killed on his couch, a clansman famous, 
in battle brave. — Nor was Beowulf there; 
another house had been held apart, 
after giving of gold, for the Geat renowned. — 
Uproar filled Heorot; the hand all had viewed, 
blood-flecked, she bore with her; bale was returned, 
dole in the dwellings: ‘twas dire exchange 
where Dane and Geat were doomed to give 
the lives of loved ones. Long-tried king, 
the hoary hero, at heart was sad 
when he knew his noble no more lived, 
and dead indeed was his dearest thane. 
To his bower was Beowulf brought in haste, 
dauntless victor. As daylight broke, 
along with his earls the atheling lord, 
with his clansmen, came where the king abode 
waiting to see if the Wielder-of-All 
would turn this tale of trouble and woe. 
Strode o’er floor the famed-in-strife, 
with his hand-companions, — the hall resounded, — 
wishing to greet the wise old king, 
Ingwines’ lord; he asked if the night 
had passed in peace to the prince’s mind. 
HROTHGAR spake, helmet-of-Scyldings:— 
“Ask not of pleasure! Pain is renewed 
to Danish folk. Dead is Aeschere, 
of Yrmenlaf the elder brother, 
my sage adviser and stay in council, 
shoulder-comrade in stress of fight 
when warriors clashed and we warded our heads, 
hewed the helm-boars; hero famed 
should be every earl as Aeschere was! 
But here in Heorot a hand hath slain him 
of wandering death-sprite. I wot not whither,    
proud of the prey, her path she took, 
fain of her fill. The feud she avenged 
that yesternight, unyieldingly, 
Grendel in grimmest grasp thou killedst, — 
seeing how long these liegemen mine 
he ruined and ravaged. Reft of life, 
in arms he fell. Now another comes, 
keen and cruel, her kin to avenge, 
faring far in feud of blood 
so that many a thane shall think, who e’er 
sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings, 
this is hardest of heart-bales. The hand lies low 
that once was willing each wish to please. 
Land-dwellers here   and liegemen mine, 
who house by those parts, I have heard relate 
that such a pair they have sometimes seen, 
march-stalkers mighty the moorland haunting, 
wandering spirits: one of them seemed, 
so far as my folk could fairly judge, 
of womankind; and one, accursed, 
in man’s guise trod the misery-track 
of exile, though huger than human bulk. 
Grendel in days long gone they named him, 
folk of the land; his father they knew not, 
nor any brood that was born to him 
of treacherous spirits. Untrod is their home; 
by wolf-cliffs haunt they and windy headlands, 
fenways fearful, where flows the stream 
from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks, 
underground flood. Not far is it hence 
in measure of miles that the mere expands, 
and o’er it the frost-bound forest hanging, 
sturdily rooted, shadows the wave. 
By night is a wonder weird to see, 
fire on the waters. So wise lived none 
of the sons of men, to search those depths! 
Nay, though the heath-rover, harried by dogs, 
the horn-proud hart, this holt should seek, 
long distance driven, his dear life first 
on the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge 
to hide his head: ‘tis no happy place! 
Thence the welter of waters washes up 
wan to welkin when winds bestir 
evil storms, and air grows dusk, 
and the heavens weep. Now is help once more 
with thee alone! The land thou knowst not, 
place of fear, where thou findest out 
that sin-flecked being. Seek if thou dare! 
I will reward thee, for waging this fight, 
with ancient treasure, as erst I did, 
with winding gold, if thou winnest back.” 
BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: 
“Sorrow not, sage! It beseems us better 
friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them. 
Each of us all must his end abide 
in the ways of the world; so win who may 
glory ere death! When his days are told, 
that is the warrior’s worthiest doom. 
Rise, O realm-warder! Ride we anon, 
and mark the trail of the mother of Grendel. 
No harbor shall hide her — heed my promise! — 
enfolding of field or forested mountain 
or floor of the flood, let her flee where she will! 
But thou this day endure in patience, 
as I ween thou wilt, thy woes each one.” 
Leaped up the graybeard: God he thanked, 
mighty Lord, for the man’s brave words. 
For Hrothgar soon a horse was saddled 
wave-maned steed. The sovran wise 
stately rode on; his shield-armed men 
followed in force. The footprints led 
along the woodland, widely seen, 
a path o’er the plain, where she passed, and trod 
the murky moor; of men-at-arms 
she bore the bravest and best one, dead, 
him who with Hrothgar the homestead ruled. 
On then went the atheling-born 
o’er stone-cliffs steep and strait defiles, 
narrow passes and unknown ways, 
headlands sheer, and the haunts of the Nicors. 
Foremost he   fared, a few at his side 
of the wiser men, the ways to scan, 
till he found in a flash the forested hill 
hanging over the hoary rock, 
a woful wood: the waves below 
were dyed in blood. The Danish men 
had sorrow of soul, and for Scyldings all, 
for many a hero, ‘twas hard to bear, 
ill for earls, when Aeschere’s head 
they found by the flood on the foreland there. 
Waves were welling, the warriors saw, 
hot with blood; but the horn sang oft 
battle-song bold. The band sat down, 
and watched on the water worm-like things, 
sea-dragons strange that sounded the deep, 
and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness — 
such as oft essay at hour of morn 
on the road-of-sails their ruthless quest, — 
and sea-snakes and monsters. These started away, 
swollen and savage that song to hear, 
that war-horn’s blast. The warden of Geats, 
with bolt from bow, then balked of life, 
of wave-work, one monster, amid its heart 
went the keen war-shaft; in water it seemed 
less doughty in swimming whom death had seized. 
Swift on the billows, with boar-spears well 
hooked and barbed, it was hard beset, 
done to death and dragged on the headland, 
wave-roamer wondrous. Warriors viewed 
the grisly guest. Then girt him Beowulf 
in martial mail, nor mourned for his life. 
His breastplate broad and bright of hues, 
woven by hand, should the waters try; 
well could it ward the warrior’s body 
that battle should break on his breast in vain 
nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe. 
And the helmet white that his head protected 
was destined to dare the deeps of the flood, 
through wave-whirl win: ‘twas wound with chains, 
decked with gold, as in days of yore 
the weapon-smith worked it wondrously, 
with swine-forms set it, that swords nowise, 
brandished in battle, could bite that helm. 
Nor was that the meanest of mighty helps 
which Hrothgar’s orator offered at need: 
“Hrunting” they named the hilted sword, 
of old-time heirlooms easily first; 
iron was its edge, all etched with poison, 
with battle-blood hardened, nor blenched it at fight 
in hero’s hand who held it ever, 
on paths of peril prepared to go 
to folkstead   of foes. Not first time this 
it was destined to do a daring task. 
For he bore not in mind, the bairn of Ecglaf 
sturdy and strong, that speech he had made, 
drunk with wine, now this weapon he lent 
to a stouter swordsman. Himself, though, durst not 
under welter of waters wager his life 
as loyal liegeman. So lost he his glory, 
honor of earls. With the other not so, 
who girded him now for the grim encounter. 
BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:— 
“Have mind, thou honored offspring of Healfdene 
gold-friend of men, now I go on this quest, 
sovran wise, what once was said: 
if in thy cause it came that I 
should lose my life, thou wouldst loyal bide 
to me, though fallen, in father’s place! 
Be guardian, thou, to this group of my thanes, 
my warrior-friends, if War should seize me; 
and the goodly gifts thou gavest me, 
Hrothgar beloved, to Hygelac send! 
Geatland’s king may ken by the gold, 
Hrethel’s son see, when he stares at the treasure, 
that I got me a friend for goodness famed, 
and joyed while I could in my jewel-bestower. 
And let Unferth wield this wondrous sword, 
earl far-honored, this heirloom precious, 
hard of edge: with Hrunting I 
seek doom of glory, or Death shall take me.” 
After these words the Weder-Geat lord 
boldly hastened, biding never 
answer at all: the ocean floods 
closed o’er the hero. Long while of the day 
fled ere he felt the floor of the sea. 
Soon found the fiend who the flood-domain 
sword-hungry held these hundred winters, 
greedy and grim, that some guest from above, 
some man, was raiding her monster-realm. 
She grasped out for him with grisly claws, 
and the warrior seized; yet scathed she not 
his body hale; the breastplate hindered, 
as she strove to shatter the sark of war, 
the linked harness, with loathsome hand. 
Then bore this brine-wolf, when bottom she touched, 
the lord of rings to the lair she haunted 
whiles vainly he strove, though his valor held, 
weapon to wield against wondrous monsters 
that sore beset him; sea-beasts many 
tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail, 
and swarmed on the stranger. But soon he marked 
he was now in some hall, he knew not which, 
where water never could work him harm, 
nor through the roof could reach him ever 
fangs of the flood. Firelight he saw, 
beams of a blaze that brightly shone. 
Then the warrior was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep, 
mere-wife monstrous. For mighty stroke 
he swung his blade, and the blow withheld not. 
Then sang on her head that seemly blade 
its war-song wild. But the warrior found 
the light-of-battle   was loath to bite, 
to harm the heart: its hard edge failed 
the noble at need, yet had known of old 
strife hand to hand, and had helmets cloven, 
doomed men’s fighting-gear. First time, this, 
for the gleaming blade that its glory fell. 
Firm still stood, nor failed in valor, 
heedful of high deeds, Hygelac’s kinsman; 
flung away fretted sword, featly jewelled, 
the angry earl; on earth it lay 
steel-edged and stiff. His strength he trusted, 
hand-gripe of might. So man shall do 
whenever in war he weens to earn him 
lasting fame, nor fears for his life! 
Seized then by shoulder, shrank not from combat, 
the Geatish war-prince Grendel’s mother. 
Flung then the fierce one, filled with wrath, 
his deadly foe, that she fell to ground. 
Swift on her part she paid him back 
with grisly grasp, and grappled with him. 
Spent with struggle, stumbled the warrior, 
fiercest of fighting-men, fell adown. 
On the hall-guest she hurled herself, hent her short sword, 
broad and brown-edged,   the bairn to avenge, 
the sole-born son. — On his shoulder lay 
braided breast-mail, barring death, 
withstanding entrance of edge or blade. 
Life would have ended for Ecgtheow’s son, 
under wide earth for that earl of Geats, 
had his armor of war not aided him, 
battle-net hard, and holy God 
wielded the victory, wisest Maker. 
The Lord of Heaven allowed his cause; 
and easily rose the earl erect. 
‘MID the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant, 
old-sword of Eotens, with edge of proof, 
warriors’ heirloom, weapon unmatched, 
— save only ‘twas more than other men 
to bandy-of-battle could bear at all — 
as the giants had wrought it, ready and keen. 
Seized then its chain-hilt the Scyldings’ chieftain, 
bold and battle-grim, brandished the sword, 
reckless of life, and so wrathfully smote 
that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard, 
her bone-rings breaking: the blade pierced through 
that fated-one’s flesh: to floor she sank. 
Bloody the blade: he was blithe of his deed. 
Then blazed forth light. ‘Twas bright within 
as when from the sky there shines unclouded 
heaven’s candle. The hall he scanned. 
By the wall then went he; his weapon raised 
high by its hilts the Hygelac-thane, 
angry and eager. That edge was not useless 
to the warrior now. He wished with speed 
Grendel to guerdon for grim raids many, 
for the war he waged on Western-Danes 
oftener far than an only time, 
when of Hrothgar’s hearth-companions 
he slew in slumber, in sleep devoured, 
fifteen men of the folk of Danes, 
and as many others outward bore, 
his horrible prey. Well paid for that 
the wrathful prince! For now prone he saw 
Grendel stretched there, spent with war, 
spoiled of life, so scathed had left him 
Heorot’s battle. The body sprang far 
when after death it endured the blow, 
sword-stroke savage, that severed its head. 
Soon,   then, saw the sage companions 
who waited with Hrothgar, watching the flood, 
that the tossing waters turbid grew, 
blood-stained the mere. Old men together, 
hoary-haired, of the hero spake; 
the warrior would not, they weened, again, 
proud of conquest, come to seek 
their mighty master. To many it seemed 
the wolf-of-the-waves had won his life. 
The ninth hour came. The noble Scyldings 
left the headland; homeward went 
the gold-friend of men.   But the guests sat on, 
stared at the surges, sick in heart, 
and wished, yet weened not, their winsome lord 
again to see. Now that sword began, 
from blood of the fight, in battle-droppings,    
war-blade, to wane: ‘twas a wondrous thing 
that all of it melted as ice is wont 
when frosty fetters the Father loosens, 
unwinds the wave-bonds, wielding all 
seasons and times: the true God he! 
Nor took from that dwelling the duke of the Geats 
precious things, though a plenty he saw, 
save only the head and that hilt withal 
blazoned with jewels: the blade had melted, 
burned was the bright sword, her blood was so hot, 
so poisoned the hell-sprite who perished within there. 
Soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat 
downfall of demons; up-dove through the flood. 
The clashing waters were cleansed now, 
waste of waves, where the wandering fiend 
her life-days left and this lapsing world. 
Swam then to strand the sailors’-refuge, 
sturdy-in-spirit, of sea-booty glad, 
of burden brave he bore with him. 
Went then to greet him, and God they thanked, 
the thane-band choice of their chieftain blithe, 
that safe and sound they could see him again. 
Soon from the hardy one helmet and armor 
deftly they doffed: now drowsed the mere, 
water ‘neath welkin, with war-blood stained. 
Forth they fared by the footpaths thence, 
merry at heart the highways measured, 
well-known roads. Courageous men 
carried the head from the cliff by the sea, 
an arduous task for all the band, 
the firm in fight, since four were needed 
on the shaft-of-slaughter   strenuously 
to bear to the gold-hall Grendel’s head. 
So presently to the palace there 
foemen fearless, fourteen Geats, 
marching came. Their master-of-clan 
mighty amid them the meadow-ways trod. 
Strode then within the sovran thane 
fearless in fight, of fame renowned, 
hardy hero, Hrothgar to greet. 
And next by the hair into hall was borne 
Grendel’s head, where the henchmen were drinking, 
an awe to clan and queen alike, 
a monster of marvel: the men looked on. 
BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:— 
“Lo, now, this sea-booty, son of Healfdene, 
Lord of Scyldings, we’ve lustily brought thee, 
sign of glory; thou seest it here. 
Not lightly did I with my life escape! 
In war under water this work I essayed 
with endless effort; and even so 
my strength had been lost had the Lord not shielded me. 
Not a whit could I with Hrunting do 
in work of war, though the weapon is good; 
yet a sword the Sovran of Men vouchsafed me 
to spy on the wall there, in splendor hanging, 
old, gigantic, — how oft He guides 
the friendless wight! — and I fought with that brand, 
felling in fight, since fate was with me, 
the house’s wardens. That war-sword then 
all burned, bright blade, when the blood gushed o’er it, 
battle-sweat hot; but the hilt I brought back 
from my foes. So avenged I their fiendish deeds 
death-fall of Danes, as was due and right. 
And this is my hest, that in Heorot now 
safe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band, 
and every thane of all thy folk 
both old and young; no evil fear, 
Scyldings’ lord, from that side again, 
aught ill for thy earls, as erst thou must!” 
Then the golden hilt, for that gray-haired leader, 
hoary hero, in hand was laid, 
giant-wrought, old. So owned and enjoyed it 
after downfall of devils, the Danish lord, 
wonder-smiths’ work, since the world was rid 
of that grim-souled fiend, the foe of God, 
murder-marked, and his mother as well. 
Now it passed into power of the people’s king, 
best of all that the oceans bound 
who have scattered their gold o’er Scandia’s isle. 
Hrothgar spake — the hilt he viewed, 
heirloom old, where was etched the rise 
of that far-off fight when the floods o’erwhelmed, 
raging waves, the race of giants 
(fearful their fate!), a folk estranged 
from God Eternal: whence guerdon due 
in that waste of waters the Wielder paid them. 
So on the guard of shining gold 
in runic staves it was rightly said 
for whom the serpent-traced sword was wrought, 
best of blades, in bygone days, 
and the hilt well wound. — The wise-one spake, 
son of Healfdene; silent were all:— 
“Lo, so may he say who sooth and right 
follows ‘mid folk, of far times mindful, 
a land-warden old,   that this earl belongs 
to the better breed! So, borne aloft, 
thy fame must fly, O friend my Beowulf, 
far and wide o’er folksteads many. Firmly thou shalt all maintain, 
mighty strength with mood of wisdom. Love of mine will I assure thee, 
as, awhile ago, I promised; thou shalt prove a stay in future, 
in far-off years, to folk of thine, 
to the heroes a help. Was not Heremod thus 
to offspring of Ecgwela, Honor-Scyldings, 
nor grew for their grace, but for grisly slaughter, 
for doom of death to the Danishmen. 
He slew, wrath-swollen, his shoulder-comrades, 
companions at board! So he passed alone, 
chieftain haughty, from human cheer. 
Though him the Maker with might endowed, 
delights of power, and uplifted high 
above all men, yet blood-fierce his mind, 
his breast-hoard, grew, no bracelets gave he 
to Danes as was due; he endured all joyless 
strain of struggle and stress of woe, 
long feud with his folk. Here find thy lesson! 
Of virtue advise thee! This verse I have said for thee, 
wise from lapsed winters. Wondrous seems 
how to sons of men Almighty God 
in the strength of His spirit sendeth wisdom, 
estate, high station: He swayeth all things. 
Whiles He letteth right lustily fare 
the heart of the hero of high-born race, — 
in seat ancestral assigns him bliss, 
his folk’s sure fortress in fee to hold, 
puts in his power great parts of the earth, 
empire so ample, that end of it 
this wanter-of-wisdom weeneth none. 
So he waxes in wealth, nowise can harm him 
illness or age; no evil cares 
shadow his spirit; no sword-hate threatens 
from ever an enemy: all the world 
wends at his will, no worse he knoweth, 
till all within him obstinate pride 
waxes and wakes while the warden slumbers, 
the spirit’s sentry; sleep is too fast 
which masters his might, and the murderer nears, 
stealthily shooting the shafts from his bow! 
“UNDER harness his heart then is hit indeed 
by sharpest shafts; and no shelter avails 
from foul behest of the hellish fiend.    
Him seems too little what long he possessed. 
Greedy and grim, no golden rings 
he gives for his pride; the promised future 
forgets he and spurns, with all God has sent him, 
Wonder-Wielder, of wealth and fame. 
Yet in the end it ever comes 
that the frame of the body fragile yields, 
fated falls; and there follows another 
who joyously the jewels divides, 
the royal riches, nor recks of his forebear. 
Ban, then, such baleful thoughts, Beowulf dearest, 
best of men, and the better part choose, 
profit eternal; and temper thy pride, 
warrior famous! The flower of thy might 
lasts now a while: but erelong it shall be 
that sickness or sword thy strength shall minish, 
or fang of fire, or flooding billow, 
or bite of blade, or brandished spear, 
or odious age; or the eyes’ clear beam 
wax dull and darken: Death even thee 
in haste shall o’erwhelm, thou hero of war! 
So the Ring-Danes these half-years a hundred I ruled, 
wielded ‘neath welkin, and warded them bravely 
from mighty-ones many o’er middle-earth, 
from spear and sword, till it seemed for me 
no foe could be found under fold of the sky. 
Lo, sudden the shift! To me seated secure 
came grief for joy when Grendel began 
to harry my home, the hellish foe; 
for those ruthless raids, unresting I suffered 
heart-sorrow heavy. Heaven be thanked, 
Lord Eternal, for life extended 
that I on this head all hewn and bloody, 
after long evil, with eyes may gaze! 
— Go to the bench now! Be glad at banquet, 
warrior worthy! A wealth of treasure 
at dawn of day, be dealt between us!” 
Glad was the Geats’ lord, going betimes 
to seek his seat, as the Sage commanded. 
Afresh, as before, for the famed-in-battle, 
for the band of the hall, was a banquet dight 
nobly anew. The Night-Helm darkened 
dusk o’er the drinkers. The doughty ones rose: 
for the hoary-headed would hasten to rest, 
aged Scylding; and eager the Geat, 
shield-fighter sturdy, for sleeping yearned. 
Him wander-weary, warrior-guest 
from far, a hall-thane heralded forth, 
who by custom courtly cared for all 
needs of a thane as in those old days 
warrior-wanderers wont to have. 
So slumbered the stout-heart. Stately the hall 
rose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on 
till a raven black the rapture-of-heaven    
blithe-heart boded. Bright came flying 
shine after shadow. The swordsmen hastened, 
athelings all were eager homeward 
forth to fare; and far from thence 
the great-hearted guest would guide his keel. 
Bade then the hardy-one Hrunting be brought 
to the son of Ecglaf, the sword bade him take, 
excellent iron, and uttered his thanks for it, 
quoth that he counted it keen in battle, 
“war-friend” winsome: with words he slandered not 
edge of the blade: ‘twas a big-hearted man! 
Now eager for parting and armed at point 
warriors waited, while went to his host 
that Darling of Danes. The doughty atheling 
to high-seat hastened and Hrothgar greeted. 
BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:— 
“Lo, we seafarers say our will, 
far-come men, that we fain would seek 
Hygelac now. We here have found 
hosts to our heart: thou hast harbored us well. 
If ever on earth I am able to win me 
more of thy love, O lord of men, 
aught anew, than I now have done, 
for work of war I am willing still! 
If it come to me ever across the seas 
that neighbor foemen annoy and fright thee, — 
as they that hate thee erewhile have used, — 
thousands then of thanes I shall bring, 
heroes to help thee. Of Hygelac I know, 
ward of his folk, that, though few his years, 
the lord of the Geats will give me aid 
by word and by work, that well I may serve thee, 
wielding the war-wood to win thy triumph 
and lending thee might when thou lackest men. 
If thy Hrethric should come to court of Geats, 
a sovran’s son, he will surely there 
find his friends. A far-off land 
each man should visit who vaunts him brave.” 
Him then answering, Hrothgar spake:— 
“These words of thine the wisest God 
sent to thy soul! No sager counsel 
from so young in years e’er yet have I heard. 
Thou art strong of main and in mind art wary, 
art wise in words! I ween indeed 
if ever it hap that Hrethel’s heir 
by spear be seized, by sword-grim battle, 
by illness or iron, thine elder and lord, 
people’s leader, — and life be thine, — 
no seemlier man will the Sea-Geats find 
at all to choose for their chief and king, 
for hoard-guard of heroes, if hold thou wilt 
thy kinsman’s kingdom! Thy keen mind pleases me 
the longer the better, Beowulf loved! 
Thou hast brought it about that both our peoples, 
sons of the Geat and Spear-Dane folk, 
shall have mutual peace, and from murderous strife, 
such as once they waged, from war refrain. 
Long as I rule this realm so wide, 
let our hoards be common, let heroes with gold 
each other greet o’er the gannet’s-bath, 
and the ringed-prow bear o’er rolling waves 
tokens of love. I trow my landfolk 
towards friend and foe are firmly joined, 
and honor they keep in the olden way.” 
To him in the hall, then, Healfdene’s son 
gave treasures twelve, and the trust-of-earls 
bade him fare with the gifts to his folk beloved, 
hale to his home, and in haste return. 
Then kissed the king of kin renowned, 
Scyldings’ chieftain, that choicest thane, 
and fell on his neck. Fast flowed the tears 
of the hoary-headed. Heavy with winters, 
he had chances twain, but he clung to this,   — 
that each should look on the other again, 
and hear him in hall. Was this hero so dear to him. 
his breast’s wild billows he banned in vain; 
safe in his soul a secret longing, 
locked in his mind, for that loved man 
burned in his blood. Then Beowulf strode, 
glad of his gold-gifts, the grass-plot o’er, 
warrior blithe. The wave-roamer bode 
riding at anchor, its owner awaiting. 
As they hastened onward, Hrothgar’s gift 
they lauded at length. — ‘Twas a lord unpeered, 
every way blameless, till age had broken 
it spareth no mortal — his splendid might. 
CAME now to ocean the ever-courageous 
hardy henchmen, their harness bearing, 
woven war-sarks. The warden marked, 
trusty as ever, the earl’s return. 
From the height of the hill no hostile words 
reached the guests as he rode to greet them; 
but “Welcome!” he called to that Weder clan 
as the sheen-mailed spoilers to ship marched on. 
Then on the strand, with steeds and treasure 
and armor their roomy and ring-dight ship 
was heavily laden: high its mast 
rose over Hrothgar’s hoarded gems. 
A sword to the boat-guard Beowulf gave, 
mounted with gold; on the mead-bench since 
he was better esteemed, that blade possessing, 
heirloom old. — Their ocean-keel boarding, 
they drove through the deep, and Daneland left. 
A sea-cloth was set, a sail with ropes, 
firm to the mast; the flood-timbers moaned;    
nor did wind over billows that wave-swimmer blow 
across from her course. The craft sped on, 
foam-necked it floated forth o’er the waves, 
keel firm-bound over briny currents, 
till they got them sight of the Geatish cliffs, 
home-known headlands. High the boat, 
stirred by winds, on the strand updrove. 
Helpful at haven the harbor-guard stood, 
who long already for loved companions 
by the water had waited and watched afar. 
He bound to the beach the broad-bosomed ship 
with anchor-bands, lest ocean-billows 
that trusty timber should tear away. 
Then Beowulf bade them bear the treasure, 
gold and jewels; no journey far 
was it thence to go to the giver of rings, 
Hygelac Hrethling: at home he dwelt 
by the sea-wall close, himself and clan. 
Haughty that house, a hero the king, 
high the hall, and Hygd   right young, 
wise and wary, though winters few 
in those fortress walls she had found a home, 
Haereth’s daughter. Nor humble her ways, 
nor grudged she gifts to the Geatish men, 
of precious treasure. Not Thryth’s pride showed she, 
folk-queen famed, or that fell deceit. 
Was none so daring that durst make bold 
(save her lord alone) of the liegemen dear 
that lady full in the face to look, 
but forged fetters he found his lot, 
bonds of death! And brief the respite; 
soon as they seized him, his sword-doom was spoken, 
and the burnished blade a baleful murder 
proclaimed and closed. No queenly way 
for woman to practise, though peerless she, 
that the weaver-of-peace   from warrior dear 
by wrath and lying his life should reave! 
But Hemming’s kinsman hindered this. — 
For over their ale men also told 
that of these folk-horrors fewer she wrought, 
onslaughts of evil, after she went, 
gold-decked bride, to the brave young prince, 
atheling haughty, and Offa’s hall 
o’er the fallow flood at her father’s bidding 
safely sought, where since she prospered, 
royal, throned, rich in goods, 
fain of the fair life fate had sent her, 
and leal in love to the lord of warriors. 
He, of all heroes I heard of ever 
from sea to sea, of the sons of earth, 
most excellent seemed. Hence Offa was praised 
for his fighting and feeing by far-off men, 
the spear-bold warrior; wisely he ruled 
over his empire. Eomer woke to him, 
help of heroes, Hemming’s kinsman, 
Grandson of Garmund, grim in war. 
HASTENED the hardy one, henchmen with him, 
sandy strand of the sea to tread 
and widespread ways. The world’s great candle, 
sun shone from south. They strode along 
with sturdy steps to the spot they knew 
where the battle-king young, his burg within, 
slayer of Ongentheow, shared the rings, 
shelter-of-heroes. To Hygelac 
Beowulf’s coming was quickly told, — 
that there in the court the clansmen’s refuge, 
the shield-companion sound and alive, 
hale from the hero-play homeward strode. 
With haste in the hall, by highest order, 
room for the rovers was readily made. 
By his sovran he sat, come safe from battle, 
kinsman by kinsman. His kindly lord 
he first had greeted in gracious form, 
with manly words. The mead dispensing, 
came through the high hall Haereth’s daughter, 
winsome to warriors, wine-cup bore 
to the hands of the heroes. Hygelac then 
his comrade fairly with question plied 
in the lofty hall, sore longing to know 
what manner of sojourn the Sea-Geats made. 
“What came of thy quest, my kinsman Beowulf, 
when thy yearnings suddenly swept thee yonder 
battle to seek o’er the briny sea, 
combat in Heorot? Hrothgar couldst thou 
aid at all, the honored chief, 
in his wide-known woes? With waves of care 
my sad heart seethed; I sore mistrusted 
my loved one’s venture: long I begged thee 
by no means to seek that slaughtering monster, 
but suffer the South-Danes to settle their feud 
themselves with Grendel. Now God be thanked 
that safe and sound I can see thee now!” 
Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow:— 
“‘Tis known and unhidden, Hygelac Lord, 
to many men, that meeting of ours, 
struggle grim between Grendel and me, 
which we fought on the field where full too many 
sorrows he wrought for the Scylding-Victors, 
evils unending. These all I avenged. 
No boast can be from breed of Grendel, 
any on earth, for that uproar at dawn, 
from the longest-lived of the loathsome race 
in fleshly fold! — But first I went 
Hrothgar to greet in the hall of gifts, 
where Healfdene’s kinsman high-renowned, 
soon as my purpose was plain to him, 
assigned me a seat by his son and heir. 
The liegemen were lusty; my life-days never 
such merry men over mead in hall 
have I heard under heaven! The high-born queen, 
people’s peace-bringer, passed through the hall, 
cheered the young clansmen, clasps of gold, 
ere she sought her seat, to sundry gave. 
Oft to the heroes Hrothgar’s daughter, 
to earls in turn, the ale-cup tendered, — 
she whom I heard these hall-companions 
Freawaru name, when fretted gold 
she proffered the warriors. Promised is she, 
gold-decked maid, to the glad son of Froda. 
Sage this seems to the Scylding’s-friend, 
kingdom’s-keeper: he counts it wise 
the woman to wed so and ward off feud, 
store of slaughter. But seldom ever 
when men are slain, does the murder-spear sink 
but briefest while, though the bride be fair!    
“Nor haply will like it the Heathobard lord, 
and as little each of his liegemen all, 
when a thane of the Danes, in that doughty throng, 
goes with the lady along their hall, 
and on him the old-time heirlooms glisten 
hard and ring-decked, Heathobard’s treasure, 
weapons that once they wielded fair 
until they lost at the linden-play    
liegeman leal and their lives as well. 
Then, over the ale, on this heirloom gazing, 
some ash-wielder old who has all in mind 
that spear-death of men,   — he is stern of mood, 
heavy at heart, — in the hero young 
tests the temper and tries the soul 
and war-hate wakens, with words like these:— 
Canst thou not, comrade, ken that sword 
which to the fray thy father carried 
in his final feud, ‘neath the fighting-mask, 
dearest of blades, when the Danish slew him 
and wielded the war-place on Withergild’s fall, 
after havoc of heroes, those hardy Scyldings? 
Now, the son of a certain slaughtering Dane, 
proud of his treasure, paces this hall, 
joys in the killing, and carries the jewel    
that rightfully ought to be owned by thee! 
Thus he urges and eggs him all the time 
with keenest words, till occasion offers 
that Freawaru’s thane, for his father’s deed, 
after bite of brand in his blood must slumber, 
losing his life; but that liegeman flies 
living away, for the land he kens. 
And thus be broken on both their sides 
oaths of the earls, when Ingeld’s breast 
wells with war-hate, and wife-love now 
after the care-billows cooler grows. 
“So   I hold not high the Heathobards’ faith 
due to the Danes, or their during love 
and pact of peace. — But I pass from that, 
turning to Grendel, O giver-of-treasure, 
and saying in full how the fight resulted, 
hand-fray of heroes. When heaven’s jewel 
had fled o’er far fields, that fierce sprite came, 
night-foe savage, to seek us out 
where safe and sound we sentried the hall. 
To Hondscio then was that harassing deadly, 
his fall there was fated. He first was slain, 
girded warrior. Grendel on him 
turned murderous mouth, on our mighty kinsman, 
and all of the brave man’s body devoured. 
Yet none the earlier, empty-handed, 
would the bloody-toothed murderer, mindful of bale, 
outward go from the gold-decked hall: 
but me he attacked in his terror of might, 
with greedy hand grasped me. A glove hung by him    
wide and wondrous, wound with bands; 
and in artful wise it all was wrought, 
by devilish craft, of dragon-skins. 
Me therein, an innocent man, 
the fiendish foe was fain to thrust 
with many another. He might not so, 
when I all angrily upright stood. 
‘Twere long to relate how that land-destroyer 
I paid in kind for his cruel deeds; 
yet there, my prince, this people of thine 
got fame by my fighting. He fled away, 
and a little space his life preserved; 
but there staid behind him his stronger hand 
left in Heorot; heartsick thence 
on the floor of the ocean that outcast fell. 
Me for this struggle the Scyldings’-friend 
paid in plenty with plates of gold, 
with many a treasure, when morn had come 
and we all at the banquet-board sat down. 
Then was song and glee. The gray-haired Scylding, 
much tested, told of the times of yore. 
Whiles the hero his harp bestirred, 
wood-of-delight; now lays he chanted 
of sooth and sadness, or said aright 
legends of wonder, the wide-hearted king; 
or for years of his youth he would yearn at times, 
for strength of old struggles, now stricken with age, 
hoary hero: his heart surged full 
when, wise with winters, he wailed their flight. 
Thus in the hall the whole of that day 
at ease we feasted, till fell o’er earth 
another night. Anon full ready 
in greed of vengeance, Grendel’s mother 
set forth all doleful. Dead was her son 
through war-hate of Weders; now, woman monstrous 
with fury fell a foeman she slew, 
avenged her offspring. From Aeschere old, 
loyal councillor, life was gone; 
nor might they e’en, when morning broke, 
those Danish people, their death-done comrade 
burn with brands, on balefire lay 
the man they mourned. Under mountain stream 
she had carried the corpse with cruel hands. 
For Hrothgar that was the heaviest sorrow 
of all that had laden the lord of his folk. 
The leader then, by thy life, besought me 
(sad was his soul) in the sea-waves’ coil 
to play the hero and hazard my being 
for glory of prowess: my guerdon he pledged. 
I then in the waters — ‘tis widely known — 
that sea-floor-guardian savage found. 
Hand-to-hand there a while we struggled; 
billows welled blood; in the briny hall 
her head I hewed with a hardy blade 
from Grendel’s mother, — and gained my life, 
though not without danger. My doom was not yet. 
Then the haven-of-heroes, Healfdene’s son, 
gave me in guerdon great gifts of price. 
 “So held this king to the customs old, 
that I wanted for nought in the wage I gained, 
the meed of my might; he made me gifts, 
Healfdene’s heir, for my own disposal. 
Now to thee, my prince, I proffer them all, 
gladly give them. Thy grace alone 
can find me favor. Few indeed 
have I of kinsmen, save, Hygelac, thee!” 
Then he bade them bear him the boar-head standard, 
the battle-helm high, and breastplate gray, 
the splendid sword; then spake in form:— 
“Me this war-gear the wise old prince, 
Hrothgar, gave, and his hest he added, 
that its story be straightway said to thee. — 
A while it was held by Heorogar king, 
for long time lord of the land of Scyldings; 
yet not to his son the sovran left it, 
to daring Heoroweard, — dear as he was to him, 
his harness of battle. — Well hold thou it all!” 
And I heard that soon passed o’er the path of this treasure, 
all apple-fallow, four good steeds, 
each like the others, arms and horses 
he gave to the king. So should kinsmen be, 
not weave one another the net of wiles, 
or with deep-hid treachery death contrive 
for neighbor and comrade. His nephew was ever 
by hardy Hygelac held full dear, 
and each kept watch o’er the other’s weal. 
I heard, too, the necklace to Hygd he presented, 
wonder-wrought treasure, which Wealhtheow gave him 
sovran’s daughter: three steeds he added, 
slender and saddle-gay. Since such gift 
the gem gleamed bright on the breast of the queen. 
Thus showed his strain the son of Ecgtheow 
as a man remarked for mighty deeds 
and acts of honor. At ale he slew not 
comrade or kin; nor cruel his mood, 
though of sons of earth his strength was greatest, 
a glorious gift that God had sent 
the splendid leader. Long was he spurned, 
and worthless by Geatish warriors held; 
him at mead the master-of-clans 
failed full oft to favor at all. 
Slack and shiftless the strong men deemed him, 
profitless prince; but payment came, 
to the warrior honored, for all his woes. — 
Then the bulwark-of-earls   bade bring within, 
hardy chieftain, Hrethel’s heirloom 
garnished with gold: no Geat e’er knew 
in shape of a sword a statelier prize. 
The brand he laid in Beowulf’s lap; 
and of hides assigned him seven thousand,    
with house and high-seat. They held in common 
land alike by their line of birth, 
inheritance, home: but higher the king 
because of his rule o’er the realm itself. 
Now further it fell with the flight of years, 
with harryings horrid, that Hygelac perished,    
and Heardred, too, by hewing of swords 
under the shield-wall slaughtered lay, 
when him at the van of his victor-folk 
sought hardy heroes, Heatho-Scilfings, 
in arms o’erwhelming Hereric’s nephew. 
Then Beowulf came as king this broad 
realm to wield; and he ruled it well 
fifty winters,   a wise old prince, 
warding his land, until One began 
in the dark of night, a Dragon, to rage. 
In the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded, 
in the stone-barrow steep. A strait path reached it, 
unknown to mortals. Some man, however, 
came by chance that cave within 
to the heathen hoard.   In hand he took 
a golden goblet, nor gave he it back, 
stole with it away, while the watcher slept, 
by thievish wiles: for the warden’s wrath 
prince and people must pay betimes! 
THAT way he went with no will of his own, 
in danger of life, to the dragon’s hoard, 
but for pressure of peril, some prince’s thane. 
He fled in fear the fatal scourge, 
seeking shelter, a sinful man, 
and entered in. At the awful sight 
tottered that guest, and terror seized him; 
yet the wretched fugitive rallied anon 
from fright and fear ere he fled away, 
and took the cup from that treasure-hoard. 
Of such besides there was store enough, 
heirlooms old, the earth below, 
which some earl forgotten, in ancient years, 
left the last of his lofty race, 
heedfully there had hidden away, 
dearest treasure. For death of yore 
had hurried all hence; and he alone 
left to live, the last of the clan, 
weeping his friends, yet wished to bide 
warding the treasure, his one delight, 
though brief his respite. The barrow, new-ready, 
to strand and sea-waves stood anear, 
hard by the headland, hidden and closed; 
there laid within it his lordly heirlooms 
and heaped hoard of heavy gold 
that warden of rings. Few words he spake: 
“Now hold thou, earth, since heroes may not, 
what earls have owned! Lo, erst from thee 
brave men brought it! But battle-death seized 
and cruel killing my clansmen all, 
robbed them of life and a liegeman’s joys. 
None have I left to lift the sword, 
or to cleanse the carven cup of price, 
beaker bright. My brave are gone. 
And the helmet hard, all haughty with gold, 
shall part from its plating. Polishers sleep 
who could brighten and burnish the battle-mask; 
and those weeds of war that were wont to brave 
over bicker of shields the bite of steel 
rust with their bearer. The ringed mail 
fares not far with famous chieftain, 
at side of hero! No harp’s delight, 
no glee-wood’s gladness! No good hawk now 
flies through the hall! Nor horses fleet 
stamp in the burgstead! Battle and death 
the flower of my race have reft away.” 
Mournful of mood, thus he moaned his woe, 
alone, for them all, and unblithe wept 
by day and by night, till death’s fell wave 
o’erwhelmed his heart. His hoard-of-bliss 
that old ill-doer open found, 
who, blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth, 
naked foe-dragon flying by night 
folded in fire: the folk of earth 
dread him sore. ‘Tis his doom to seek 
hoard in the graves, and heathen gold 
to watch, many-wintered: nor wins he thereby! 
Powerful this plague-of-the-people thus 
held the house of the hoard in earth 
three hundred winters; till One aroused 
wrath in his breast, to the ruler bearing 
that costly cup, and the king implored 
for bond of peace. So the barrow was plundered, 
borne off was booty. His boon was granted 
that wretched man; and his ruler saw 
first time what was fashioned in far-off days. 
When the dragon awoke, new woe was kindled. 
O’er the stone he snuffed. The stark-heart found 
footprint of foe who so far had gone 
in his hidden craft by the creature’s head. — 
So may the undoomed easily flee 
evils and exile, if only he gain 
the grace of The Wielder! — That warden of gold 
o’er the ground went seeking, greedy to find 
the man who wrought him such wrong in sleep. 
Savage and burning, the barrow he circled 
all without; nor was any there, 
none in the waste.... Yet war he desired, 
was eager for battle. The barrow he entered, 
sought the cup, and discovered soon 
that some one of mortals had searched his treasure, 
his lordly gold. The guardian waited 
ill-enduring till evening came; 
boiling with wrath was the barrow’s keeper, 
and fain with flame the foe to pay 
for the dear cup’s loss. — Now day was fled 
as the worm had wished. By its wall no more 
was it glad to bide, but burning flew 
folded in flame: a fearful beginning 
for sons of the soil; and soon it came, 
in the doom of their lord, to a dreadful end. 
THEN the baleful fiend its fire belched out, 
and bright homes burned. The blaze stood high 
all landsfolk frighting. No living thing 
would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew. 
Wide was the dragon’s warring seen, 
its fiendish fury far and near, 
as the grim destroyer those Geatish people 
hated and hounded. To hidden lair, 
to its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn. 
Folk of the land it had lapped in flame, 
with bale and brand. In its barrow it trusted, 
its battling and bulwarks: that boast was vain! 
To Beowulf then the bale was told 
quickly and truly: the king’s own home, 
of buildings the best, in brand-waves melted, 
that gift-throne of Geats. To the good old man 
sad in heart, ‘twas heaviest sorrow. 
The sage assumed that his sovran God 
he had angered, breaking ancient law, 
and embittered the Lord. His breast within 
with black thoughts welled, as his wont was never. 
The folk’s own fastness that fiery dragon 
with flame had destroyed, and the stronghold all 
washed by waves; but the warlike king, 
prince of the Weders, plotted vengeance. 
Warriors’-bulwark, he bade them work 
all of iron — the earl’s commander — 
a war-shield wondrous: well he knew 
that forest-wood against fire were worthless, 
linden could aid not. — Atheling brave, 
he was fated to finish this fleeting life,    
his days on earth, and the dragon with him, 
though long it had watched o’er the wealth of the hoard! — 
Shame he reckoned it, sharer-of-rings, 
to follow the flyer-afar with a host, 
a broad-flung band; nor the battle feared he, 
nor deemed he dreadful the dragon’s warring, 
its vigor and valor: ventures desperate 
he had passed a-plenty, and perils of war, 
contest-crash, since, conqueror proud, 
Hrothgar’s hall he had wholly purged, 
and in grapple had killed the kin of Grendel, 
loathsome breed! Not least was that 
of hand-to-hand fights where Hygelac fell, 
when the ruler of Geats in rush of battle, 
lord of his folk, in the Frisian land, 
son of Hrethel, by sword-draughts died, 
by brands down-beaten. Thence Beowulf fled 
through strength of himself and his swimming power, 
though alone, and his arms were laden with thirty 
coats of mail, when he came to the sea! 
Nor yet might Hetwaras   haughtily boast 
their craft of contest, who carried against him 
shields to the fight: but few escaped 
from strife with the hero to seek their homes! 
Then swam over ocean Ecgtheow’s son 
lonely and sorrowful, seeking his land, 
where Hygd made him offer of hoard and realm, 
rings and royal-seat, reckoning naught 
the strength of her son to save their kingdom 
from hostile hordes, after Hygelac’s death. 
No sooner for this could the stricken ones 
in any wise move that atheling’s mind 
over young Heardred’s head as lord 
and ruler of all the realm to be: 
yet the hero upheld him with helpful words, 
aided in honor, till, older grown, 
he wielded the Weder-Geats. — Wandering exiles 
sought him o’er seas, the sons of Ohtere, 
who had spurned the sway of the Scylfings’-helmet, 
the bravest and best that broke the rings, 
in Swedish land, of the sea-kings’ line, 
haughty hero.   Hence Heardred’s end. 
For shelter he gave them, sword-death came, 
the blade’s fell blow, to bairn of Hygelac; 
but the son of Ongentheow sought again 
house and home when Heardred fell, 
leaving Beowulf lord of Geats 
and gift-seat’s master. — A good king he! 
THE fall of his lord he was fain to requite 
in after days; and to Eadgils he proved 
friend to the friendless, and forces sent 
over the sea to the son of Ohtere, 
weapons and warriors: well repaid he 
those care-paths cold when the king he slew.    
Thus safe through struggles the son of Ecgtheow 
had passed a plenty, through perils dire, 
with daring deeds, till this day was come 
that doomed him now with the dragon to strive. 
With comrades eleven the lord of Geats 
swollen in rage went seeking the dragon. 
He had heard whence all the harm arose 
and the killing of clansmen; that cup of price 
on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder. 
In the throng was this one thirteenth man, 
starter of all the strife and ill, 
care-laden captive; cringing thence 
forced and reluctant, he led them on 
till he came in ken of that cavern-hall, 
the barrow delved near billowy surges, 
flood of ocean. Within ‘twas full 
of wire-gold and jewels; a jealous warden, 
warrior trusty, the treasures held, 
lurked in his lair. Not light the task 
of entrance for any of earth-born men! 
Sat on the headland the hero king, 
spake words of hail to his hearth-companions, 
gold-friend of Geats. All gloomy his soul, 
wavering, death-bound. Wyrd full nigh 
stood ready to greet the gray-haired man, 
to seize his soul-hoard, sunder apart 
life and body. Not long would be 
the warrior’s spirit enwound with flesh. 
Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow:— 
“Through store of struggles I strove in youth, 
mighty feuds; I mind them all. 
I was seven years old when the sovran of rings, 
friend-of-his-folk, from my father took me, 
had me, and held me, Hrethel the king, 
with food and fee, faithful in kinship. 
Ne’er, while I lived there, he loathlier found me, 
bairn in the burg, than his birthright sons, 
Herebeald and Haethcyn and Hygelac mine. 
For the eldest of these, by unmeet chance, 
by kinsman’s deed, was the death-bed strewn, 
when Haethcyn killed him with horny bow, 
his own dear liege laid low with an arrow, 
missed the mark and his mate shot down, 
one brother the other, with bloody shaft. 
A feeless fight,   and a fearful sin, 
horror to Hrethel; yet, hard as it was, 
unavenged must the atheling die! 
Too awful it is for an aged man 
to bide and bear, that his bairn so young 
rides on the gallows. A rime he makes, 
sorrow-song for his son there hanging 
as rapture of ravens; no rescue now 
can come from the old, disabled man! 
Still is he minded, as morning breaks, 
of the heir gone elsewhere;   another he hopes not 
he will bide to see his burg within 
as ward for his wealth, now the one has found 
doom of death that the deed incurred. 
Forlorn he looks on the lodge of his son, 
wine-hall waste and wind-swept chambers 
reft of revel. The rider sleepeth, 
the hero, far-hidden;   no harp resounds, 
in the courts no wassail, as once was heard. 
“THEN he goes to his chamber, a grief-song chants 
alone for his lost. Too large all seems, 
homestead and house. So the helmet-of-Weders 
hid in his heart for Herebeald 
waves of woe. No way could he take 
to avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul; 
nor e’en could he harass that hero at all 
with loathing deed, though he loved him not. 
And so for the sorrow his soul endured, 
men’s gladness he gave up and God’s light chose. 
Lands and cities he left his sons 
(as the wealthy do) when he went from earth. 
There was strife and struggle ‘twixt Swede and Geat 
o’er the width of waters; war arose, 
hard battle-horror, when Hrethel died, 
and Ongentheow’s offspring grew 
strife-keen, bold, nor brooked o’er the seas 
pact of peace, but pushed their hosts 
to harass in hatred by Hreosnabeorh. 
Men of my folk for that feud had vengeance, 
for woful war (‘tis widely known), 
though one of them bought it with blood of his heart, 
a bargain hard: for Haethcyn proved 
fatal that fray, for the first-of-Geats. 
At morn, I heard, was the murderer killed 
by kinsman for kinsman,   with clash of sword, 
when Ongentheow met Eofor there. 
Wide split the war-helm: wan he fell, 
hoary Scylfing; the hand that smote him 
of feud was mindful, nor flinched from the death-blow. 
— “For all that he   gave me, my gleaming sword 
repaid him at war, — such power I wielded, — 
for lordly treasure: with land he entrusted me, 
homestead and house. He had no need 
from Swedish realm, or from Spear-Dane folk, 
or from men of the Gifths, to get him help, — 
some warrior worse for wage to buy! 
Ever I fought in the front of all, 
sole to the fore; and so shall I fight 
while I bide in life and this blade shall last 
that early and late hath loyal proved 
since for my doughtiness Daeghrefn fell, 
slain by my hand, the Hugas’ champion. 
Nor fared he thence to the Frisian king 
with the booty back, and breast-adornments; 
but, slain in struggle, that standard-bearer 
fell, atheling brave. Not with blade was he slain, 
but his bones were broken by brawny gripe, 
his heart-waves stilled. — The sword-edge now, 
hard blade and my hand, for the hoard shall strive.” 
Beowulf spake, and a battle-vow made 
his last of all: “I have lived through many 
wars in my youth; now once again, 
old folk-defender, feud will I seek, 
do doughty deeds, if the dark destroyer 
forth from his cavern come to fight me!” 
Then hailed he the helmeted heroes all, 
for the last time greeting his liegemen dear, 
comrades of war: “I should carry no weapon, 
no sword to the serpent, if sure I knew 
how, with such enemy, else my vows 
I could gain as I did in Grendel’s day. 
But fire in this fight I must fear me now, 
and poisonous breath; so I bring with me 
breastplate and board.   From the barrow’s keeper 
no footbreadth flee I. One fight shall end 
our war by the wall, as Wyrd allots, 
all mankind’s master. My mood is bold 
but forbears to boast o’er this battling-flyer. 
— Now abide by the barrow, ye breastplate-mailed, 
ye heroes in harness, which of us twain 
better from battle-rush bear his wounds. 
Wait ye the finish. The fight is not yours, 
nor meet for any but me alone 
to measure might with this monster here 
and play the hero. Hardily I 
shall win that wealth, or war shall seize, 
cruel killing, your king and lord!” 
Up stood then with shield the sturdy champion, 
stayed by the strength of his single manhood, 
and hardy ‘neath helmet his harness bore 
under cleft of the cliffs: no coward’s path! 
Soon spied by the wall that warrior chief, 
survivor of many a victory-field 
where foemen fought with furious clashings, 
an arch of stone; and within, a stream 
that broke from the barrow. The brooklet’s wave 
was hot with fire. The hoard that way 
he never could hope unharmed to near, 
or endure those deeps,   for the dragon’s flame. 
Then let from his breast, for he burst with rage, 
the Weder-Geat prince a word outgo; 
stormed the stark-heart; stern went ringing 
and clear his cry ‘neath the cliff-rocks gray. 
The hoard-guard heard a human voice; 
his rage was enkindled. No respite now 
for pact of peace! The poison-breath 
of that foul worm first came forth from the cave, 
hot reek-of-fight: the rocks resounded. 
Stout by the stone-way his shield he raised, 
lord of the Geats, against the loathed-one; 
while with courage keen that coiled foe 
came seeking strife. The sturdy king 
had drawn his sword, not dull of edge, 
heirloom old; and each of the two 
felt fear of his foe, though fierce their mood. 
Stoutly stood with his shield high-raised 
the warrior king, as the worm now coiled 
together amain: the mailed-one waited. 
Now, spire by spire, fast sped and glided 
that blazing serpent. The shield protected, 
soul and body a shorter while 
for the hero-king than his heart desired, 
could his will have wielded the welcome respite 
but once in his life! But Wyrd denied it, 
and victory’s honors. — His arm he lifted 
lord of the Geats, the grim foe smote 
with atheling’s heirloom. Its edge was turned 
brown blade, on the bone, and bit more feebly 
than its noble master had need of then 
in his baleful stress. — Then the barrow’s keeper 
waxed full wild for that weighty blow, 
cast deadly flames; wide drove and far 
those vicious fires. No victor’s glory 
the Geats’ lord boasted; his brand had failed, 
naked in battle, as never it should, 
excellent iron! — ‘Twas no easy path 
that Ecgtheow’s honored heir must tread 
over the plain to the place of the foe; 
for against his will he must win a home 
elsewhere far, as must all men, leaving 
this lapsing life! — Not long it was 
ere those champions grimly closed again. 
The hoard-guard was heartened; high heaved his breast 
once more; and by peril was pressed again, 
enfolded in flames, the folk-commander! 
Nor yet about him his band of comrades, 
sons of athelings, armed stood 
with warlike front: to the woods they bent them, 
their lives to save. But the soul of one 
with care was cumbered. Kinship true 
can never be marred in a noble mind! 
WIGLAF his name was, Weohstan’s son, 
linden-thane loved, the lord of Scylfings, 
Aelfhere’s kinsman. His king he now saw 
with heat under helmet hard oppressed. 
He minded the prizes his prince had given him, 
wealthy seat of the Waegmunding line, 
and folk-rights that his father owned 
Not long he lingered. The linden yellow, 
his shield, he seized; the old sword he drew: — 
as heirloom of Eanmund earth-dwellers knew it, 
who was slain by the sword-edge, son of Ohtere, 
friendless exile, erst in fray 
killed by Weohstan, who won for his kin 
brown-bright helmet, breastplate ringed, 
old sword of Eotens, Onela’s gift, 
weeds of war of the warrior-thane, 
battle-gear brave: though a brother’s child 
had been felled, the feud was unfelt by Onela.    
For winters this war-gear Weohstan kept, 
breastplate and board, till his bairn had grown 
earlship to earn as the old sire did: 
then he gave him, mid Geats, the gear of battle, 
portion huge, when he passed from life, 
fared aged forth. For the first time now 
with his leader-lord the liegeman young 
was bidden to share the shock of battle. 
Neither softened his soul, nor the sire’s bequest 
weakened in war.   So the worm found out 
when once in fight the foes had met! 
Wiglaf spake, — and his words were sage; 
sad in spirit, he said to his comrades:— 
“I remember the time, when mead we took, 
what promise we made to this prince of ours 
in the banquet-hall, to our breaker-of-rings, 
for gear of combat to give him requital, 
for hard-sword and helmet, if hap should bring 
stress of this sort! Himself who chose us 
from all his army to aid him now, 
urged us to glory, and gave these treasures, 
because he counted us keen with the spear 
and hardy ‘neath helm, though this hero-work 
our leader hoped unhelped and alone 
to finish for us, — folk-defender 
who hath got him glory greater than all men 
for daring deeds! Now the day is come 
that our noble master has need of the might 
of warriors stout. Let us stride along 
the hero to help while the heat is about him 
glowing and grim! For God is my witness 
I am far more fain the fire should seize 
along with my lord these limbs of mine!    
Unsuiting it seems our shields to bear 
homeward hence, save here we essay 
to fell the foe and defend the life 
of the Weders’ lord. I wot ‘twere shame 
on the law of our land if alone the king 
out of Geatish warriors woe endured 
and sank in the struggle! My sword and helmet, 
breastplate and board, for us both shall serve!” 
Through slaughter-reek strode he to succor his chieftain, 
his battle-helm bore, and brief words spake:— 
“Beowulf dearest, do all bravely, 
as in youthful days of yore thou vowedst 
that while life should last thou wouldst let no wise 
thy glory droop! Now, great in deeds, 
atheling steadfast, with all thy strength 
shield thy life! I will stand to help thee.” 
At the words the worm came once again, 
murderous monster mad with rage, 
with fire-billows flaming, its foes to seek, 
the hated men. In heat-waves burned 
that board   to the boss, and the breastplate failed 
to shelter at all the spear-thane young. 
Yet quickly under his kinsman’s shield 
went eager the earl, since his own was now 
all burned by the blaze. The bold king again 
had mind of his glory: with might his glaive 
was driven into the dragon’s head, — 
blow nerved by hate. But Naegling   was shivered, 
broken in battle was Beowulf’s sword, 
old and gray. ‘Twas granted him not 
that ever the edge of iron at all 
could help him at strife: too strong was his hand, 
so the tale is told, and he tried too far 
with strength of stroke all swords he wielded, 
though sturdy their steel: they steaded him nought. 
Then for the third time thought on its feud 
that folk-destroyer, fire-dread dragon, 
and rushed on the hero, where room allowed, 
battle-grim, burning; its bitter teeth 
closed on his neck, and covered him 
with waves of blood from his breast that welled. 
‘TWAS now, men say, in his sovran’s need 
that the earl made known his noble strain, 
craft and keenness and courage enduring. 
Heedless of harm, though his hand was burned, 
hardy-hearted, he helped his kinsman. 
A little lower the loathsome beast 
he smote with sword; his steel drove in 
bright and burnished; that blaze began 
to lose and lessen. At last the king 
wielded his wits again, war-knife drew, 
a biting blade by his breastplate hanging, 
and the Weders’-helm smote that worm asunder, 
felled the foe, flung forth its life. 
So had they killed it, kinsmen both, 
athelings twain: thus an earl should be 
in danger’s day! — Of deeds of valor 
this conqueror’s-hour of the king was last, 
of his work in the world. The wound began, 
which that dragon-of-earth had erst inflicted, 
to swell and smart; and soon he found 
in his breast was boiling, baleful and deep, 
pain of poison. The prince walked on, 
wise in his thought, to the wall of rock; 
then sat, and stared at the structure of giants, 
where arch of stone and steadfast column 
upheld forever that hall in earth. 
Yet here must the hand of the henchman peerless 
lave with water his winsome lord, 
the king and conqueror covered with blood, 
with struggle spent, and unspan his helmet. 
Beowulf spake in spite of his hurt, 
his mortal wound; full well he knew 
his portion now was past and gone 
of earthly bliss, and all had fled 
of his file of days, and death was near: 
“I would fain bestow on son of mine 
this gear of war, were given me now 
that any heir should after me come 
of my proper blood. This people I ruled 
fifty winters. No folk-king was there, 
none at all, of the neighboring clans 
who war would wage me with ‘warriors’-friends’    
and threat me with horrors. At home I bided 
what fate might come, and I cared for mine own; 
feuds I sought not, nor falsely swore 
ever on oath. For all these things, 
though fatally wounded, fain am I! 
From the Ruler-of-Man no wrath shall seize me, 
when life from my frame must flee away, 
for killing of kinsmen! Now quickly go 
and gaze on that hoard ‘neath the hoary rock, 
Wiglaf loved, now the worm lies low, 
sleeps, heart-sore, of his spoil bereaved. 
And fare in haste. I would fain behold 
the gorgeous heirlooms, golden store, 
have joy in the jewels and gems, lay down 
softlier for sight of this splendid hoard 
my life and the lordship I long have held.” 
I HAVE heard that swiftly the son of Weohstan 
at wish and word of his wounded king, — 
war-sick warrior, — woven mail-coat, 
battle-sark, bore ‘neath the barrow’s roof. 
Then the clansman keen, of conquest proud, 
passing the seat,   saw store of jewels 
and glistening gold the ground along; 
by the wall were marvels, and many a vessel 
in the den of the dragon, the dawn-flier old: 
unburnished bowls of bygone men 
reft of richness; rusty helms 
of the olden age; and arm-rings many 
wondrously woven. — Such wealth of gold, 
booty from barrow, can burden with pride 
each human wight: let him hide it who will! — 
His glance too fell on a gold-wove banner 
high o’er the hoard, of handiwork noblest, 
brilliantly broidered; so bright its gleam, 
all the earth-floor he easily saw 
and viewed all these vessels. No vestige now 
was seen of the serpent: the sword had ta’en him. 
Then, I heard, the hill of its hoard was reft, 
old work of giants, by one alone; 
he burdened his bosom with beakers and plate 
at his own good will, and the ensign took, 
brightest of beacons. — The blade of his lord 
— its edge was iron — had injured deep 
one that guarded the golden hoard 
many a year and its murder-fire 
spread hot round the barrow in horror-billows 
at midnight hour, till it met its doom. 
Hasted the herald, the hoard so spurred him 
his track to retrace; he was troubled by doubt, 
high-souled hero, if haply he’d find 
alive, where he left him, the lord of Weders, 
weakening fast by the wall of the cave. 
So he carried the load. His lord and king 
he found all bleeding, famous chief 
at the lapse of life. The liegeman again 
plashed him with water, till point of word 
broke through the breast-hoard. Beowulf spake, 
sage and sad, as he stared at the gold. — 
“For the gold and treasure, to God my thanks, 
to the Wielder-of-Wonders, with words I say, 
for what I behold, to Heaven’s Lord, 
for the grace that I give such gifts to my folk 
or ever the day of my death be run! 
Now I’ve bartered here for booty of treasure 
the last of my life, so look ye well 
to the needs of my land! No longer I tarry. 
A barrow bid ye the battle-fanned raise 
for my ashes. ‘Twill shine by the shore of the flood, 
to folk of mine memorial fair 
on Hrones Headland high uplifted, 
that ocean-wanderers oft may hail 
Beowulf’s Barrow, as back from far 
they drive their keels o’er the darkling wave.” 
From his neck he unclasped the collar of gold, 
valorous king, to his vassal gave it 
with bright-gold helmet, breastplate, and ring, 
to the youthful thane: bade him use them in joy. 
“Thou art end and remnant of all our race 
the Waegmunding name. For Wyrd hath swept them, 
all my line, to the land of doom, 
earls in their glory: I after them go.” 
This word was the last which the wise old man 
harbored in heart ere hot death-waves 
of balefire he chose. From his bosom fled 
his soul to seek the saints’ reward. 
IT was heavy hap for that hero young 
on his lord beloved to look and find him 
lying on earth with life at end, 
sorrowful sight. But the slayer too, 
awful earth-dragon, empty of breath, 
lay felled in fight, nor, fain of its treasure, 
could the writhing monster rule it more. 
For edges of iron had ended its days, 
hard and battle-sharp, hammers’ leaving;    
and that flier-afar had fallen to ground 
hushed by its hurt, its hoard all near, 
no longer lusty aloft to whirl 
at midnight, making its merriment seen, 
proud of its prizes: prone it sank 
by the handiwork of the hero-king. 
Forsooth among folk but few achieve, 
— though sturdy and strong, as stories tell me, 
and never so daring in deed of valor, — 
the perilous breath of a poison-foe 
to brave, and to rush on the ring-board hall, 
whenever his watch the warden keeps 
bold in the barrow. Beowulf paid 
the price of death for that precious hoard; 
and each of the foes had found the end 
of this fleeting life. Befell erelong 
that the laggards in war the wood had left, 
trothbreakers, cowards, ten together, 
fearing before to flourish a spear 
in the sore distress of their sovran lord. 
Now in their shame their shields they carried, 
armor of fight, where the old man lay; 
and they gazed on Wiglaf. Wearied he sat 
at his sovran’s shoulder, shieldsman good, 
to wake him with water.   Nowise it availed. 
Though well he wished it, in world no more 
could he barrier life for that leader-of-battles 
nor baffle the will of all-wielding God. 
Doom of the Lord was law o’er the deeds 
of every man, as it is to-day. 
Grim was the answer, easy to get, 
from the youth for those that had yielded to fear! 
Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan, — 
mournful he looked on those men unloved:— 
“Who sooth will speak, can say indeed 
that the ruler who gave you golden rings 
and the harness of war in which ye stand 
— for he at ale-bench often-times 
bestowed on hall-folk helm and breastplate, 
lord to liegemen, the likeliest gear 
which near of far he could find to give, — 
threw away and wasted these weeds of battle, 
on men who failed when the foemen came! 
Not at all could the king of his comrades-in-arms 
venture to vaunt, though the Victory-Wielder, 
God, gave him grace that he got revenge 
sole with his sword in stress and need. 
To rescue his life, ‘twas little that I 
could serve him in struggle; yet shift I made 
(hopeless it seemed) to help my kinsman. 
Its strength ever waned, when with weapon I struck 
that fatal foe, and the fire less strongly 
flowed from its head. — Too few the heroes 
in throe of contest that thronged to our king! 
Now gift of treasure and girding of sword, 
joy of the house and home-delight 
shall fail your folk; his freehold-land 
every clansman within your kin 
shall lose and leave, when lords highborn 
hear afar of that flight of yours, 
a fameless deed. Yea, death is better 
for liegemen all than a life of shame!” 
THAT battle-toil bade he at burg to announce, 
at the fort on the cliff, where, full of sorrow, 
all the morning earls had sat, 
daring shieldsmen, in doubt of twain: 
would they wail as dead, or welcome home, 
their lord beloved? Little   kept back 
of the tidings new, but told them all, 
the herald that up the headland rode. — 
“Now the willing-giver to Weder folk 
in death-bed lies; the Lord of Geats 
on the slaughter-bed sleeps by the serpent’s deed! 
And beside him is stretched that slayer-of-men 
with knife-wounds sick:   no sword availed 
on the awesome thing in any wise 
to work a wound. There Wiglaf sitteth, 
Weohstan’s bairn, by Beowulf’s side, 
the living earl by the other dead, 
and heavy of heart a head-watch   keeps 
o’er friend and foe. — Now our folk may look 
for waging of war when once unhidden 
to Frisian and Frank the fall of the king 
is spread afar. — The strife began 
when hot on the Hugas   Hygelac fell 
and fared with his fleet to the Frisian land. 
Him there the Hetwaras humbled in war, 
plied with such prowess their power o’erwhelming 
that the bold-in-battle bowed beneath it 
and fell in fight. To his friends no wise 
could that earl give treasure! And ever since 
the Merowings’ favor has failed us wholly. 
Nor aught expect I of peace and faith 
from Swedish folk. ‘Twas spread afar 
how Ongentheow reft at Ravenswood 
Haethcyn Hrethling of hope and life, 
when the folk of Geats for the first time sought 
in wanton pride the Warlike-Scylfings. 
Soon the sage old sire   of Ohtere, 
ancient and awful, gave answering blow; 
the sea-king   he slew, and his spouse redeemed, 
his good wife rescued, though robbed of her gold, 
mother of Ohtere and Onela. 
Then he followed his foes, who fled before him 
sore beset and stole their way, 
bereft of a ruler, to Ravenswood. 
With his host he besieged there what swords had left, 
the weary and wounded; woes he threatened 
the whole night through to that hard-pressed throng: 
some with the morrow his sword should kill, 
some should go to the gallows-tree 
for rapture of ravens. But rescue came 
with dawn of day for those desperate men 
when they heard the horn of Hygelac sound, 
tones of his trumpet; the trusty king 
had followed their trail with faithful band. 
THE bloody swath of Swedes and Geats 
and the storm of their strife, were seen afar, 
how folk against folk the fight had wakened. 
The ancient king with his atheling band 
sought his citadel, sorrowing much: 
Ongentheow earl went up to his burg. 
He had tested Hygelac’s hardihood, 
the proud one’s prowess, would prove it no longer, 
defied no more those fighting-wanderers 
nor hoped from the seamen to save his hoard, 
his bairn and his bride: so he bent him again, 
old, to his earth-walls. Yet after him came 
with slaughter for Swedes the standards of Hygelac 
o’er peaceful plains in pride advancing, 
till Hrethelings fought in the fenced town.    
Then Ongentheow with edge of sword, 
the hoary-bearded, was held at bay, 
and the folk-king there was forced to suffer 
Eofor’s anger. In ire, at the king 
Wulf Wonreding with weapon struck; 
and the chieftain’s blood, for that blow, in streams 
flowed ‘neath his hair. No fear felt he, 
stout old Scylfing, but straightway repaid 
in better bargain that bitter stroke 
and faced his foe with fell intent. 
Nor swift enough was the son of Wonred 
answer to render the aged chief; 
too soon on his head the helm was cloven; 
blood-bedecked he bowed to earth, 
and fell adown; not doomed was he yet, 
and well he waxed, though the wound was sore. 
Then the hardy Hygelac-thane,    
when his brother fell, with broad brand smote, 
giants’ sword crashing through giants’-helm 
across the shield-wall: sank the king, 
his folk’s old herdsman, fatally hurt. 
There were many to bind the brother’s wounds 
and lift him, fast as fate allowed 
his people to wield the place-of-war. 
But Eofor took from Ongentheow, 
earl from other, the iron-breastplate, 
hard sword hilted, and helmet too, 
and the hoar-chief’s harness to Hygelac carried, 
who took the trappings, and truly promised 
rich fee ‘mid folk, — and fulfilled it so. 
For that grim strife gave the Geatish lord, 
Hrethel’s offspring, when home he came, 
to Eofor and Wulf a wealth of treasure, 
Each of them had a hundred thousand    
in land and linked rings; nor at less price reckoned 
mid-earth men such mighty deeds! 
And to Eofor he gave his only daughter 
in pledge of grace, the pride of his home. 
“Such is the feud, the foeman’s rage, 
death-hate of men: so I deem it sure 
that the Swedish folk will seek us home 
for this fall of their friends, the fighting-Scylfings, 
when once they learn that our warrior leader 
lifeless lies, who land and hoard 
ever defended from all his foes, 
furthered his folk’s weal, finished his course 
a hardy hero. — Now haste is best, 
that we go to gaze on our Geatish lord, 
and bear the bountiful breaker-of-rings 
to the funeral pyre. No fragments merely 
shall burn with the warrior. Wealth of jewels, 
gold untold and gained in terror, 
treasure at last with his life obtained, 
all of that booty the brands shall take, 
fire shall eat it. No earl must carry 
memorial jewel. No maiden fair 
shall wreathe her neck with noble ring: 
nay, sad in spirit and shorn of her gold, 
oft shall she pass o’er paths of exile 
now our lord all laughter has laid aside, 
all mirth and revel. Many a spear 
morning-cold shall be clasped amain, 
lifted aloft; nor shall lilt of harp 
those warriors wake; but the wan-hued raven, 
fain o’er the fallen, his feast shall praise 
and boast to the eagle how bravely he ate 
when he and the wolf were wasting the slain.” 
So he told his sorrowful tidings, 
and little   he lied, the loyal man 
of word or of work. The warriors rose; 
sad, they climbed to the Cliff-of-Eagles, 
went, welling with tears, the wonder to view. 
Found on the sand there, stretched at rest, 
their lifeless lord, who had lavished rings 
of old upon them. Ending-day 
had dawned on the doughty-one; death had seized 
in woful slaughter the Weders’ king. 
There saw they, besides, the strangest being, 
loathsome, lying their leader near, 
prone on the field. The fiery dragon, 
fearful fiend, with flame was scorched. 
Reckoned by feet, it was fifty measures 
in length as it lay. Aloft erewhile 
it had revelled by night, and anon come back, 
seeking its den; now in death’s sure clutch 
it had come to the end of its earth-hall joys. 
By it there stood the stoups and jars; 
dishes lay there, and dear-decked swords 
eaten with rust, as, on earth’s lap resting, 
a thousand winters they waited there. 
For all that heritage huge, that gold 
of bygone men, was bound by a spell,    
so the treasure-hall could be touched by none 
of human kind, — save that Heaven’s King, 
God himself, might give whom he would, 
Helper of Heroes, the hoard to open, — 
even such a man as seemed to him meet. 
A PERILOUS path, it proved, he   trod 
who heinously hid, that hall within, 
wealth under wall! Its watcher had killed 
one of a few,   and the feud was avenged 
in woful fashion. Wondrous seems it, 
what manner a man of might and valor 
oft ends his life, when the earl no longer 
in mead-hall may live with loving friends. 
So Beowulf, when that barrow’s warden 
he sought, and the struggle; himself knew not 
in what wise he should wend from the world at last. 
For   princes potent, who placed the gold, 
with a curse to doomsday covered it deep, 
so that marked with sin the man should be, 
hedged with horrors, in hell-bonds fast, 
racked with plagues, who should rob their hoard. 
Yet no greed for gold, but the grace of heaven, 
ever the king had kept in view.    
Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan:— 
“At the mandate of one, oft warriors many 
sorrow must suffer; and so must we. 
The people’s-shepherd showed not aught 
of care for our counsel, king beloved! 
That guardian of gold he should grapple not, urged we, 
but let him lie where he long had been 
in his earth-hall waiting the end of the world, 
the hest of heaven. — This hoard is ours 
but grievously gotten; too grim the fate 
which thither carried our king and lord. 
I was within there, and all I viewed, 
the chambered treasure, when chance allowed me 
(and my path was made in no pleasant wise) 
under the earth-wall. Eager, I seized 
such heap from the hoard as hands could bear 
and hurriedly carried it hither back 
to my liege and lord. Alive was he still, 
still wielding his wits. The wise old man 
spake much in his sorrow, and sent you greetings 
and bade that ye build, when he breathed no more, 
on the place of his balefire a barrow high, 
memorial mighty. Of men was he 
worthiest warrior wide earth o’er 
the while he had joy of his jewels and burg. 
Let us set out in haste now, the second time 
to see and search this store of treasure, 
these wall-hid wonders, — the way I show you, — 
where, gathered near, ye may gaze your fill 
at broad-gold and rings. Let the bier, soon made, 
be all in order when out we come, 
our king and captain to carry thither 
— man beloved — where long he shall bide 
safe in the shelter of sovran God.” 
Then the bairn of Weohstan bade command, 
hardy chief, to heroes many 
that owned their homesteads, hither to bring 
firewood from far — o’er the folk they ruled — 
for the famed-one’s funeral. “ Fire shall devour 
and wan flames feed on the fearless warrior 
who oft stood stout in the iron-shower, 
when, sped from the string, a storm of arrows 
shot o’er the shield-wall: the shaft held firm, 
featly feathered, followed the barb.” 
And now the sage young son of Weohstan 
seven chose of the chieftain’s thanes, 
the best he found that band within, 
and went with these warriors, one of eight, 
under hostile roof. In hand one bore 
a lighted torch and led the way. 
No lots they cast for keeping the hoard 
when once the warriors saw it in hall, 
altogether without a guardian, 
lying there lost. And little they mourned 
when they had hastily haled it out, 
dear-bought treasure! The dragon they cast, 
the worm, o’er the wall for the wave to take, 
and surges swallowed that shepherd of gems. 
Then the woven gold on a wain was laden — 
countless quite! — and the king was borne, 
hoary hero, to Hrones-Ness. 
THEN fashioned for him the folk of Geats 
firm on the earth a funeral-pile, 
and hung it with helmets and harness of war 
and breastplates bright, as the boon he asked; 
and they laid amid it the mighty chieftain, 
heroes mourning their master dear. 
Then on the hill that hugest of balefires 
the warriors wakened. Wood-smoke rose 
black over blaze, and blent was the roar 
of flame with weeping (the wind was still), 
till the fire had broken the frame of bones, 
hot at the heart. In heavy mood 
their misery moaned they, their master’s death. 
Wailing her woe, the widow   old, 
her hair upbound, for Beowulf’s death 
sung in her sorrow, and said full oft 
she dreaded the doleful days to come, 
deaths enow, and doom of battle, 
and shame. — The smoke by the sky was devoured. 
The folk of the Weders fashioned there 
on the headland a barrow broad and high, 
by ocean-farers far descried: 
in ten days’ time their toil had raised it, 
the battle-brave’s beacon. Round brands of the pyre 
a wall they built, the worthiest ever 
that wit could prompt in their wisest men. 
They placed in the barrow that precious booty, 
the rounds and the rings they had reft erewhile, 
hardy heroes, from hoard in cave, — 
trusting the ground with treasure of earls, 
gold in the earth, where ever it lies 
useless to men as of yore it was. 
Then about that barrow the battle-keen rode, 
atheling-born, a band of twelve, 
lament to make, to mourn their king, 
chant their dirge, and their chieftain honor. 
They praised his earlship, his acts of prowess 
worthily witnessed: and well it is 
that men their master-friend mightily laud, 
heartily love, when hence he goes 
from life in the body forlorn away. 
Thus made their mourning the men of Geatland, 
for their hero’s passing his hearth-companions: 
quoth that of all the kings of earth, 
of men he was mildest and most beloved, 
to his kin the kindest, keenest for praise.</poem_text>

		<title>What Kind of Times Are These</title>
		<poem_text>There&#39;s a place between two stands of trees where the grass grows uphill 
and the old revolutionary road breaks off into shadows 
near a meeting-house abandoned by the persecuted 
who disappeared into those shadows. 
I&#39;ve walked there picking mushrooms at the edge of dread, but don&#39;t be fooled 
this isn&#39;t a Russian poem, this is not somewhere else but here, 
our country moving closer to its own truth and dread, 
its own ways of making people disappear. 
I won&#39;t tell you where the place is, the dark mesh of the woods 
meeting the unmarked strip of light— 
ghost-ridden crossroads, leafmold paradise: 
I know already who wants to buy it, sell it, make it disappear. 
And I won&#39;t tell you where it is, so why do I tell you 
anything? Because you still listen, because in times like these 
to have you listen at all, it&#39;s necessary

		<poem_text>                    I drew solitude over me, on the long shore.                                         —Robinson Jeffers, “Prelude”               For whoever does not afflict his soul through this day, shall be           cut off from his people.                                                                            —Leviticus 23:29
					What is a Jew in solitude?
 What would it mean not to feel lonely or afraid
 far from your own or those you have called your own?
 What is a woman in solitude:   a queer woman or man?
 In the empty street, on the empty beach, in the desert
 what in this world as it is can solitude mean?
  
 The glassy, concrete octagon suspended from the cliffs
 with its electric gate, its perfected privacy
 is not what I mean
 the pick-up with a gun parked at a turn-out in Utah or the Golan Heights
 is not what I mean
 the poet’s tower facing the western ocean, acres of forest planted to the east, the woman reading in the cabin, her attack dog suddenly risen
 is not what I mean
  
 Three thousand miles from what I once called home
 I open a book searching for some lines I remember
 about flowers, something to bind me to this coast as lilacs in the dooryard once
 bound me back there—yes, lupines on a burnt mountainside,
 something that bloomed and faded and was written down
 in the poet’s book, forever:
 Opening the poet’s book
 I find the hatred in the poet’s heart: . . . the hateful-eyed
 and human-bodied are all about me: you that love multitude may have them
  
 Robinson Jeffers, multitude
 is the blur flung by distinct forms against these landward valleys
 and the farms that run down to the sea; the lupines
 are multitude, and the torched poppies, the grey Pacific unrolling its scrolls of surf,
 and the separate persons, stooped
 over sewing machines in denim dust, bent under the shattering skies of harvest
 who sleep by shifts in never-empty beds have their various dreams
 Hands that pick, pack, steam, stitch, strip, stuff, shell, scrape, scour, belong to a brain like no other
 Must I argue the love of multitude in the blur or defend
 a solitude of barbed-wire and searchlights, the survivalist’s final solution, have I a choice?
  
 To wonder far from your own or those you have called your own
 to hear strangeness calling you from far away
 and walk in that direction, long and far, not calculating risk
 to go to meet the Stranger without fear or weapon, protection nowhere on your mind
 (the Jew on the icy, rutted road on Christmas Eve prays for another Jew
 the woman in the ungainly twisting shadows of the street:   Make those be a woman’s footsteps; as if she could believe in a woman’s god)
  
 Find someone like yourself.   Find others.
 Agree you will never desert each other.
 Understand that any rift among you
 means power to those who want to do you in.
 Close to the center, safety; toward the edges, danger.
 But I have a nightmare to tell:   I am trying to say
 that to be with my people is my dearest wish
 but that I also love strangers
 that I crave separateness
 I hear myself stuttering these words
 to my worst friends and my best enemies
 who watch for my mistakes in grammar
 my mistakes in love.
 This is the day of atonement; but do my people forgive me?
 If a cloud knew loneliness and fear, I would be that cloud.
  
 To love the Stranger, to love solitude—am I writing merely about privelege
 about drifting from the center, drawn to edges,
 a privilege we can’t afford in the world that is,
 who are hated as being of our kind: faggot kicked into the icy river, woman dragged from her stalled car
 into the mist-struck mountains, used and hacked to death
 young scholar shot at the university gates on a summer evening walk, his prizes and studies nothing, nothing availing his Blackness
 Jew deluded that she’s escaped the tribe, the laws of her exclusion, the men too holy to touch her hand;   Jew who has turned her back
 on midrash and mitzvah (yet wears the chai on a thong between her breasts) hiking alone
 found with a swastika carved in her back at the foot of the cliffs (did she die as queer or as Jew?)
  
 Solitude, O taboo, endangered species
 on the mist-struck spur of the mountain, I want a gun to defend you
 In the desert, on the deserted street, I want what I can’t have:
 your elder sister, Justice, her great peasant’s hand outspread
 her eye, half-hooded, sharp and true  
  
 And I ask myself, have I thrown courage away?
 have I traded off something I don’t name?
 To what extreme will I go to meet the extremist?
 What will I do to defend my want or anyone’s want to search for her spirit-vision
 far from the protection of those she has called her own?
 Will I find O solitude
 your plumes, your breasts, your hair
 against my face, as in childhood, your voice like the mockingbird’s
 singing Yes, you are loved, why else this song?
 in the old places, anywhere?
  
 What is a Jew in solitude?
 What is a woman in solitude, a queer woman or man?
 When the winter flood-tides wrench the tower from the rock, crumble the prophet’s headland, and the farms slide into the sea
 when leviathan is endangered and Jonah becomes revenger
 when center and edges are crushed together, the extremities crushed together on which the world was founded
 when our souls crash together, Arab and Jew, howling our loneliness within the tribes
 when the refugee child and the exile’s child re-open the blasted and forbidden city
 when we who refuse to be women and men as women and men are chartered, tell our stories of solitude spent in multitude
 in that world as it may be, newborn and haunted, what will solitude mean?

		<title>What Work Is</title>
		<poem_text>We stand in the rain in a long line 
waiting at Ford Highland Park. For work. 
You know what work is—if you’re 
old enough to read this you know what 
work is, although you may not do it. 
Forget you. This is about waiting, 
shifting from one foot to another. 
Feeling the light rain falling like mist 
into your hair, blurring your vision 
until you think you see your own brother 
ahead of you, maybe ten places. 
You rub your glasses with your fingers, 
and of course it’s someone else’s brother, 
narrower across the shoulders than 
yours but with the same sad slouch, the grin 
that does not hide the stubbornness, 
the sad refusal to give in to 
rain, to the hours of wasted waiting, 
to the knowledge that somewhere ahead 
a man is waiting who will say, “No, 
we’re not hiring today,” for any 
reason he wants. You love your brother, 
now suddenly you can hardly stand 
the love flooding you for your brother, 
who’s not beside you or behind or 
ahead because he’s home trying to   
sleep off a miserable night shift 
at Cadillac so he can get up 
before noon to study his German. 
Works eight hours a night so he can sing 
Wagner, the opera you hate most, 
the worst music ever invented. 
How long has it been since you told him 
you loved him, held his wide shoulders, 
opened your eyes wide and said those words, 
and maybe kissed his cheek? You’ve never 
done something so simple, so obvious, 
not because you’re too young or too dumb, 
not because you’re jealous or even mean 
or incapable of crying in 
the presence of another man, no,   
just because you don’t know what work is.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>To the students of anatomy  at Indiana University
					That gaunt old man came first, his hair as white 
As your scoured tables. Maybe you’ll recollect him 
By the scars of steelmill burns on the backs of his hands, 
On the nape of his neck, on his arms and sinewy legs, 
And her by the enduring innocence 
Of her face, as open to all of you in death 
As it would have been in life: she would memorize 
Your names and ages and pastimes and hometowns 
If she could, but she can’t now, so remember her. 
They believed in doctors, listened to their advice, 
And followed it faithfully. You should treat them 
One last time as they would have treated you. 
They had been kind to others all their lives 
And believed in being useful. Remember somewhere 
Their son is trying hard to believe you’ll learn 
As much as possible from them, as he did, 
And will do your best to learn politely and truly. 
They gave away the gift of those useful bodies 
Against his wish. (They had their own ways 
Of doing everything, always.) If you’re not certain 
Which ones are theirs, be gentle to everybody.</poem_text>

		<title>Trying to Write a Poem While the Couple in the Apartment Overhead Make Love</title>
		<poem_text>She&#39;s like a singer straying slowly off key 
 while trying too hard to remember the words to a song 
 without words, and her accompanist 
is metronomically dead set 
 to sustain her pitch and tempo, and meanwhile, 
 under their   feathers and springs, under their carpet, 
under my own ceiling, I try to go on 
 making something or other out of nothing 
 but those missing words, whose rhythm is only 
predictable for unpredictable moments 
 and then erratic, unforeseeable even 
 at its source where it ought to be abundantly, 
even painfully clear. A song is a series of vowels 
 interrupted and shaped by consonants 
 and silence, and gifted singers say if you can 
pronounce words and remember how to breathe, 
 you can sing. Although I know some words by heart 
 and think I know how to breathe (even down here 
at work alone) and may be able sometimes 
 to write some of them down, right now it seems 
 improbable they&#39;ll have anything much like 
the permissive diction, the mounting cadences, 
 now, or then, or now again the suspended 
 poise, the drift backward, the surprise 
of the suddenly almost soundless catch 
 of the caught breath, the quick 
 loss of support 
which wasn&#39;t lost at all as it turns out 
 but found again and even again 
 somewhere, in midair, far, far above me.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>The last time I saw Paul Castle
it was printed in gold on the wall
above the showers in the boys’
locker room, next to the school
record for the mile. I don’t recall
his time, but the year was 1968
and I can look across the infield
of memory to see him on the track,
legs flashing, body bending slightly
beyond the pack of runners at his back.
He couldn’t spare a word for me,
two years younger, junior varsity,
and hardly worth the waste of breath.
He owned the hallways, a cool blonde
at his side, and aimed his interests
further down the line than we could guess.
Now, reading the name again,
I see us standing in the showers,
naked kids beneath his larger,
comprehensive force—the ones who trail
obscurely, in the wake of the swift,
like my shadow on this gleaming wall.</poem_text>

 John hands me a cold one

 I am not in Vietnam,

 our deferments came through,

Limited Midwestern repertoire.   
Cigarette going in the ashtray,

Everything was simmering   
Just below the steel lid

The beef into submission,   
Chopped her way

In the indoor pool. Outside 
It is snowing, but I am warm 
And weightless, suspended and out 
Of time like a fly in amber. 
 
She is thousands of miles 
From here, and miles above me, 
Ghosting the stratosphere, 
Heading from New York to London. 
Though it is late, even 
At that height, I know her light 
Is on, her window a square 
Of gold as she reads mysteries 
Above the Atlantic. I watch 
 
The line of black tile on the pool’s 
Floor, leading me down the lane. 
If she looks down by moonlight, 
Under a clear sky, she will see 
Black water. She will see me 
Swimming distantly, moving far 
From shore, suspended with her 
In flight through the wide gulf 
As we swim toward land together.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>[The Washerwoman]
					    When bright Orion glitters in the skies
In winter nights, then early we must rise;
The weather ne’er so bad, wind, rain or snow,
Our work appointed, we must rise and go,
While you on easy beds may lie and sleep,
Till light does through your chamber-windows peep.
When to the house we come where we should go,
How to get in, alas! we do not know:
The maid quite tired with work the day before,
O’ercome with sleep; we standing at the door,
Oppressed with cold, and often call in vain,
Ere to our work we can admittance gain.
But when from wind and weather we get in,
Briskly with courage we our work begin;
Heaps of fine linen we before us view,
Whereon to lay our strength and patience too;
Cambrics and muslins, which our ladies wear,
Laces and edgings, costly, fine and rare,
Which must be washed with utmost skill and care;
With holland shirts, ruffles and fringes too,
Fashions which our forefathers never knew.
For several hours here we work and slave,
Before we can one glimpse of daylight have;
We labor hard before the morning’s past,
Because we fear the time runs on too fast.
    At length bright Sol illuminates the skies,
And summons drowsy mortals to arise;
Then comes our mistress to us without fail,
And in her hand, perhaps, a mug of ale
To cheer our hearts, and also to inform
Herself what work is done that very morn;
Lays her commands upon us, that we mind
Her linen well, nor leave the dirt behind.
Not this alone, but also to take care
We don’t her cambrics nor her ruffles tear;
And these most strictly does of us require,
To save her soap and sparing be of fire;
Tells us her charge is great, nay furthermore,
Her clothes are fewer than the time before.
Now we drive on, resolved our strength to try,
And what we can we do most willingly;
Until with heat and work, ’tis often known,
Not only sweat but blood runs trickling down
Our wrists and fingers: still our work demands
The constant action of our laboring hands.
    Now night comes on, from whence you have relief,
But that, alas! does not increase our grief.
With heavy hearts we often view the sun,
Fearing he’ll set before our work is done;
For, either in the morning or at night,
We piece the summer’s day with candlelight.
Though we all day with care our work attend,
Such is our fate, we know not when ’twill end.
When evening’s come, you homeward take your way;
We, till our work is done, are forced to stay,
And, after all our toil and labor past,
Sixpence or eightpence pays us off at last;
For all our pains no prospect can we see
Attend us, but old age and poverty.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>It sounds unconvincing to say When I was young
Though I have long wondered what it would be like
To be me now
No older at all it seems from here
As far from myself as ever
Walking in fog and rain and seeing nothing
I imagine all the clocks have died in the night
Now no one is looking I could choose my age
It would be younger I suppose so I am older
It is there at hand I could take it
Except for the things I think I would do differently
They keep coming between they are what I am
They have taught me little I did not know when I was young
There is nothing wrong with my age now probably
It is how I have come to it
Like a thing I kept putting off as I did my youth
There is nothing the matter with speech
Just because it lent itself
To my uses
Of course there is nothing the matter with the stars
It is my emptiness among them
While they drift farther away in the invisible morning</poem_text>

		<title>Ninety-Fifth Street</title>
		<poem_text>Words can bang around in your head
 Forever, if you let them and you give them room.
 I used to love poetry, and mostly I still do, 
Though sometimes “I, too, dislike it.” There must be 
Something real beyond the fiddle and perfunctory
Consolations and the quarrels—as of course
There is, though what it is is difficult to say.
The salt is on the briar rose, the fog is in the fir trees.
I didn’t know what it was, and I don’t know now,
But it was what I started out to do, and now, a lifetime later,    
All I’ve really done. The Opening of the Field, 
Roots and Branches, Rivers and Mountains: I sat in my room
Alone, their fragments shored against the ruin or revelation
That was sure to come, breathing in their secret atmosphere,
Repeating them until they almost seemed my own.
We like to think our lives are what they study to become,
And yet so much of life is waiting, waiting on a whim.
So much of what we are is sheer coincidence,
Like a sentence whose significance is retrospective,
Made up out of elementary particles that are in some sense
Simply sounds, like syllables that finally settle into place.
You probably think that this is a poem about poetry 
(And obviously it is), yet its real subject is time, 
For that’s what poetry is—a way to live through time 
And sometimes, just for a while, to bring it back.

A paneled dining room in Holder Hall. Stage right, enter twit:
“Mr. Ashbery, I’m your biggest campus fan.” We hit it off
And talked about “The Skaters” and my preference for “Clepsydra” 
Vs. “Fragment.” Later on that night John asked me to a party in New York, 
And Saturday, after dinner and a panel on the artist’s role as something 
(And a party), driving Lewis’s Austin-Healey through the rain 
I sealed our friendship with an accident. The party was on Broadway,
An apartment (white of course, with paintings) just downstairs
From Frank O’Hara’s, who finally wandered down. I talked to him
A little about Love Poems (Tentative Title), which pleased him,
And quoted a line from “Poem” about the rain, which seemed to please him too.
The party ended, John and I went off to Max’s, ordered steaks 
And talked about our mothers. All that talking!—poems and paintings,
Parents, all those parties, and the age of manifestos still to come!
I started coming to New York for lunch. We’d meet at Art News,
Walk to Fifty-sixth Street to Larre’s, a restaurant filled with French expatriates,
Have martinis and the prix fixe for $2.50 (!), drink rose de Provence
And talk (of course) about Genet and James and words like “Coca-Cola.”
It was an afternoon in May when John brought up a play
That he and Kenneth Koch and Frank O’Hara—Holy Trinity!
(Batman was in vogue)—had started years ago and never finished.
There was a dictator named Edgar and some penicillin,
But that’s all I remember. They hadn’t actually been together
In years, but planned to finish it that night at John’s new apartment
On Ninety-fifth Street, and he said to come by for a drink
Before they ate and got to work. It was a New York dream
Come true: a brownstone floor-through, white and full of paintings
(Naturally), “with a good library and record collection.”
John had procured a huge steak, and as I helped him set the table
The doorbell rang and Frank O’Hara, fresh from the museum
And svelte in a hound’s tooth sports coat entered, followed shortly
By “excitement-prone Kenneth Koch” in somber gray,
And I was one with my immortals. In the small mythologies
We make up out of memories and the flow of time
A few moments remain frozen, though the feel of them is lost,
The feel of talk. It ranged from puns to gossip, always coming back 
To poems and poets. Frank was fiercely loyal to young poets
(Joe Ceravolo’s name came up I think), and when I mentioned Lewis
In a way that must have sounded catty, he leapt to his defense,
Leaving me to backtrack in embarrassment and have another drink,
Which is what everyone had. I think you see where it was going:
Conversation drifting into dinner, then I stayed for dinner
And everyone forgot about the play, which was never finished
(Though I think I’ve seen a fragment of it somewhere). I see a table
In a cone of light, but there’s no sound except for Kenneth’s 
Deadpan “Love to see a boy eat” as I speared a piece of steak;
And then the only voice I’m sure I hear is mine,
As those moments that had once seemed singular and clear
Dissolve into a “general mess of imprecision of feeling”
And images, augmented by line breaks. There were phone calls,
Other people arrived, the narrative of the night dissolved
And finally everyone went home. School and spring wound down.
The semester ended, then the weekend that I wrote about in “Sally’s Hair”
Arrived and went, and then a late-night cruise around Manhattan for a rich friend’s
Parents’ anniversary bash, followed by an Upper East Side preppie bar
That left me looking for a place to crash, and so I rang John’s bell at 2 AM
And failed (thank God) to rouse him, caught a plane to San Diego
The next day, worked at my summer job and worked on poems
And started reading Proust, and got a card one afternoon
From Peter Schjeldahl telling me that Frank O’Hara had been killed.
Ninety-fifth Street soldiered on for several years.
I remember a cocktail party (the symposium of those days),
Followed by dinner just around the corner at Elaine’s,
Pre-Woody Allen. It was there I learned of R.F.K.’s assassination
When I woke up on the daybed in the living room, and where
John told me getting married would ruin me as a poet
(I don’t know why—most of his friends were married), a judgment
He revised when he met Susan and inscribed The Double Dream of Spring
“If this is all we need fear from spinach, then I don’t mind so much”
(Which was probably premature—watering his plants one day
She soaked his landlord, Giorgio Cavallon, dozing in the garden below).
It was where Peter Delacorte late one night recited an entire side
Of a Firesign Theatre album from memory, and set John on that path,
To his friends’ subsequent dismay, and where he blessed me with his extra copy
Of The Poems, and next day had second thoughts (though I kept it anyway). 
Sometimes a vague, amorphous stretch of years assumes a shape,
And then becomes an age, and then a golden age alive with possibilities,
When change was in the air and you could wander through its streets
As though through Florence and the Renaissance. I know it sounds ridiculous,
But that’s the way life flows: in stages that take form in retrospect,
When all the momentary things that occupy the mind from day to day
Have vanished into time, and something takes their place that wasn’t there,
A sense of freedom—one which gradually slipped away. The center
Of the conversation moved downtown, the Renaissance gave way to mannerism
As the junior faculty took charge, leaving the emeriti alone and out of it
Of course, lying on the fringes, happily awake; but for the rest 
The laws proscribing what you couldn’t do were clear. I got so tired
Of writing all those New York poems (though by then I’d moved to Boston—
To Siena, you might say) that led to nowhere but the next one,
So I started writing poems about whatever moved me: what it’s like
To be alive within a world that holds no place for you, yet seems so beautiful;
The feeling of the future, and its disappointments; the trajectory of a life,
That always brought me back to time and memory (I’d finished Proust by then),
And brings me back to this. John finally moved downtown himself,
Into a two-story apartment at Twenty-fifth and Tenth, with a spiral staircase 
Leading to a library, the locus of the incident of Susan, Alydar and John 
And the pitcher of water (I’ll draw a veil over it), and Jimmy Schuyler sighing
“It’s so beautiful,” as Bernadette Peters sang “Raining in My Heart” from Dames at Sea.
The poetry still continued—mine and everyone’s. I’d added Jimmy 
To my pantheon (as you’ve probably noticed), but the night in nineteen sixty-six 
Seemed more and more remote: I never saw Kenneth anymore,
And there were new epicenters, with new casts of characters, like Madoo, 
Bob Dash’s garden in Sagaponack, and Bill and Willy’s loft in Soho.
John moved again, to Twenty-second Street, and Susan and I moved to Milwaukee,
Where our son was born. I stopped coming to New York, and writing poems, 
For several years, while I tried to dream enough philosophy for tenure.
One afternoon in May I found myself at Ninth and Twenty-second,
And as though on cue two people whom I hadn’t seen in years—David Kalstone, 
Darragh Park—just happened by, and then I took a taxi down to Soho
To the loft, and then a gallery to hear Joe Brainard read from I Remember,
Back to John’s and out to dinner—as though I’d never been away, 
Though it was all too clear I had. Poems were in the air, but theory too, 
And members of the thought police department (who must have also gotten tenure) 
Turned up everywhere, with arguments that poetry was called upon to prove.
It mattered, but in a different way, as though it floated free from poems
And wasn’t quite the point. I kept on coming back, as I still do.
Half my life was still to come, and yet the rest was mostly personal:
I got divorced, and Willy killed himself, and here I am now, ready to retire.
There was an obituary in the Times last week for Michael Goldberg,
A painter you’ll recall from Frank O’Hara’s poems (“Why I Am Not a Painter,”
“Ode to Michael Goldberg (’s Birth and Other Births)”). I didn’t know him,
But a few months after the soiree on Ninety-fifth Street I was at a party
In his studio on the Bowery, which was still his studio when he died.
The New York art world demimonde was there, including nearly everyone
Who’s turned up in this poem. I remember staring at a guy who
Looked like something from the Black Lagoon, dancing with a gorgeous
Woman half his age. That’s my New York: an island dream
Of personalities and evenings, nights where poetry was second nature
And their lives flowed through it and around it as it gave them life.
O brave new world (now old) that had such people in’t!

*     *     *

“The tiresome old man is telling us his life story.” 
I guess I am, but that’s what poets do—not always 
Quite as obviously as this, and usually more by indirection
And omission, but beneath the poetry lies the singular reality 
And unreality of an individual life. I see it as a long,
Illuminated tunnel, lined with windows giving on the scenes outside—
On Ninety-fifth Street forty years ago. As life goes on
You start to get increasingly distracted by your own reflection
And the darkness gradually becoming visible at the end. 
I try not to look too far ahead, but just to stay here— 
Quick now, here, now, always—only something pulls me
Back (as they say) to the day, when poems were more like secrets,
With their own vernacular, and you could tell your friends 
By who and what they read. And now John’s practically become 
A national treasure, and whenever I look up I think I see him 
Floating in the sky like the Cheshire Cat. I don’t know
What to make of it, but it makes me happy—like seeing Kenneth 
Just before he died (“I’m going west John, I’m going west”) 
In his apartment on a side street near Columbia, or remembering
Once again that warm spring night in nineteen sixty-six. 
I like to think of them together once again, at the cocktail party
At the end of the mind, where I could blunder in and ruin it one last time.
Meanwhile, on a hillside in the driftless region to the west,
A few miles from the small town where The Straight Story ends,
I’m building a house on a meadow, if I’m permitted to return,
Behind a screen of trees above a lower meadow, with some apple trees
In which the fog collects on autumn afternoons, and a vista
Of an upland pasture without heaviness. I see myself
Sitting on the deck and sipping a martini, as I used to at Larre’s, 
In a future that feels almost like a past I’m positive is there— 
But where? I think my life is still all conversation,
Only now it’s with myself. I can see it continuing forever,
Even in my absence, as I close the windows and turn off the lights
And it begins to rain. And then we’re there together 
In the house on the meadow, waiting for whatever’s left to come
In what’s become the near future—two versions of myself 
And of the people that we knew, each one an other
To the other, yet both indelibly there: the twit of twenty
And the aging child of sixty-two, still separate
And searching in the night, listening through the night
To the noise of the rain and memories of rain
And evenings when we’d wander out into the Renaissance,
When I could see you and talk to you and it could still change;
And still there in the morning when the rain has stopped,
And the apples are all getting tinted in the cool light.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>We sold it. To a man
who would be a patriarch.
I told John we were closed in,
subdivisions and trailers all around,
complaints of the smell (though
there was none), Ira came out
and told me to keep them fenced
(though none broke out), the neighbors
frightened because someone’s cousin’s
friend heard of a hog
that ate a child who fell in the pen (though
their children rode my sows
at feeding time), because I was tired,
because Jan carried our child and could
no longer help, because she wanted a home.
And the patriarch lost his first crop
to weeds, threw a rod in the tractor,
dug a basement and moved the trailer on
for extra bedrooms, cut the water lines
for a ditch, subdivided the farm
and sold the pigs for sausage. I told John
they were his, they were no longer mine,
I couldn’t be responsible.
The wire connecting our voices was silent

was seeping into my hair
Somebody said:
“He’s out of his bottle”
I guess it meant
Temporarily out of service and empty.
But then there was Arsene
beside the last remaining cabin
wandering with his eyes on the camera
Dynamite in his pocket
and a piece of thread
to trap a rabbit.
Evil is a growing thing
It has its own gravity
and never answers to its name
It is a hole into chaos. It is real
Arsene held me in his arms
He was drunk as usual
and his nipple smelled of rum
But still I loved him—
loved him madly!—
as if he was the one</poem_text>

		<title>A Time of Bees</title>
		<poem_text>Love is never strong enough to find the words befitting it.                                                                        CAMUS
					All day my husband pounds on the upstairs porch.
 Screeches and grunts of wood as the wall is opened
 keep the whole house tormented. He is trying to reach
 the bees, he is after bees. This is the climax, an end
 to two summers of small operations with sprays and ladders.
 Last June on the porch floor I found them dead,
 a sprinkle of dusty bugs, and next day a still worse
 death, until, like falling in love, bee-haunted,
 I swept up bigger and bigger loads of some hatch,
 I thought, sickened, and sickening me, from what origin?
 My life centered on bees, all floors were suspect. The search
 was hopeless. Windows were shut. I never find
 where anything comes from. But in June my husband’s fierce
 sallies began, inspections, cracks located
 and sealed, insecticides shot; outside, the bees’ course
  
 watched, charted; books on bees read.
 I tell you I swept up bodies every day on the porch.
 Then they’d stop, the problem was solved; then they were there again,
 as the feelings make themselves known again, as they beseech
 sleepers who live innocently in will and mind. 
  
 It is no surprise to those who walk with their tigers
 that the bees were back, no surprise to me. But they had 
 left themselves so lack-luster, their black and gold furs
 so deathly faded. Gray bugs that the broom hunted
 were like a thousand little stops when some great lurch
  
 of heart takes place, or a great shift of season.
 November it came to an end. No bees. And I could watch 
 the floor, clean and cool, and, from windows, the cold land.
 But this spring the thing began again, and his curse
 went upstairs again, and his tinkering and reasoning and pride.
  
 It is the man who takes hold. I lived from bees, but his force
 went out after bees and found them in the wall where they hid.
 And now in July he is tearing out the wall, and each
 board ripped brings them closer to his hunting hand.
 It is quiet, has been quiet for a while. He calls me, and I march
  
 from a dream of bees to see them, winged and unwinged,
 such a mess of interrupted life dumped on newspapers—
 dirty clots of grubs, sawdust, stuck fliers, all smeared
 together with old honey, they writhe, some of them, but who cares?
 They go to the garbage, it is over, everything has been said.
  
 But there is more. Wouldn’t you think the bees had suffered
 enough? This evening we go to a party, the breeze 
 dies, late, we are sticky in our old friendships and light-headed.
 We tell our funny story about the bees.
 At two in the morning we come home, and a friend,
  
 a scientist, comes with us, in his car. We’re going to save
 the idea of the thing, a hundred bees, if we can find
 so many unrotted, still warm but harmless, and leave
 the rest. We hope that the neighbors are safe in bed,
 taking no note of these private catastrophes.
  
 He wants an enzyme in the flight-wing muscle. Not a bad
 thing to look into. In the night we rattle and raise 
 the lid of the garbage can. Flashlights in hand,
 we open newspapers, and the men reach in a salve
 of happenings. I can’t touch it. I hate the self-examined
  
 who’ve killed the self. The dead are darker, but the others have
 moved in the ooze toward the next moment. My God
 one half-worm gets its wings right before our eyes.
 Searching fingers sort and lay bare, they need
 the idea of bees—and yet, under their touch, the craze
  
 for life gets stronger in the squirming, whitish kind.
 The men do it. Making a claim on the future, as love
 makes a claim on the future, grasping. And I, underhand,
 I feel it start, a terrible, lifelong heave
 taking direction. Unpleading, the men prod
  
 till all that grubby softness wants to give, to give.</poem_text>

Then the younger brother said in avoice full of scorn. &#39;Oh you fool. You lazy man. Youwere married to meat and you thought it was a wife.&#39;&quot;    FROM A MYTH OF THE BUSHMEN
					Poised upside down on its duncecap,
 a shrunken purple head,
 True Blueberry,
 enters its tightening frame of orange lip,

 Zanzibar Cocoa, while
       Here at the Martha Washington
       Ice Cream Store
       we outdo the Symbolistes.

 Pistachio? Mint Julep?

 sweetens his chin.
 In front of me Licorice teeters like a lump of coal
 on its pinkish base of Pumpkin.
       A Rauschenberg tongue
       fondles this rich donnée,
       then begins to erase it.
  
 Turning from all that is present
 in the flesh, so to speak,
 let the eye wander off to a menu,
 where it can start to ingest
 “Quite Sour Lemon sherbet
 topped with a stem cherry and chocolate sprinkles
      Swilling in language,
 all floating in bubbly cherry phosphate
      the bloated imagination 
      is urged to open still wider
      and shovel it in,
 and served with a twist of pretzel.”
 In this world “Creamy Vanilla and
 Smooth Swiss Chocolate ice creams”
 can be “blended with chopped pineapple,
 dark fudge sauce, ripe bananas, whipped topping,
 cookies, roasted nutmeats and nippy chopped cherries.”
     the Unconscious, that old hog,
     being in charge here of the 
     creative act.
  
 At about the moment my tastebuds
 receive a last tickle of Gingersnap
 and begin to respond to 
 Orange Fudge, I look at you
 who have bought my ice cream cones for twenty years,
     Moving another new ice to the mouth
     we needn’t remember
 and look away
     it is always the same mouth
     that melts it.
 My mind assembles a ribald tower
 of sherbet dips, all on one cone,
 Apricot, Apple, Tangerine, Peach, Prune, Lime,
 and then it topples.
 You are steadier than I.
 You order one dip always,
 or, in a dish, two dips of the same flavor.
  
 In this hysterical brilliance of neon
     Come on, consumers, 
     we’ve got to keep scooping
 it is twelve or fifteen of us
 to thirty ice creams.
     so that the creams shall not rise
      like cold lava out of their bins,
      numbing our feet, our knees,
      freezing our chests, our chins, our eyes,
 Open the door, quick, 
 and let in two handholding adolescents.
 Coping with all those glands
 makes them good and hungry.
     so that, flying out of their cannisters,
     the chopped nuts
     shall not top off our Technicolor grave
     with their oily ashes.
  
 Listen! All around us toothsome cones
 are suffering demolition
 down to the last, nipple-like tip.
 How do we know where to stop?
 Perhaps the glasses and dishes
 are moulded of candy, and the counters and windows…
       Over your half-eaten serving of Italian Delight,
       why are you looking at me
       the way you are looking at me?

		<title>Waterlily Fire</title>
		<poem_text>for Richard Griffith ?
					1  THE BURNING
  
 Girl grown woman     fire     mother of fire
 I go to the stone street turning to fire.     Voices
 Go screaming     Fire     to the green glass wall.
 And there where my youth flies blazing into fire
 The     dance     of sane and insane images, noon
 Of seasons and days.     Noontime of my one hour.
  
 Saw down the bright noon street the crooked faces
 Among the tall daylight in the city of change.
 The scene has walls     stone     glass     all my gone life
 One wall a web through which the moment walks
 And I am open, and the opened hour
 The world as water-garden     lying behind it.
 In a city of stone, necessity of fountains,
 Forces water fallen on glass, men with their axes.
  
 An arm of flame reaches from water-green glass,
 Behind the wall I know waterlilies
 Drinking their light, transforming light and our eyes
 Skythrown under water, clouds under those flowers,
 Walls standing on all things stand in a city noon
 Who will not believe a waterlily fire.
 Whatever can happen in a city of stone,
 Whatever can come to a wall can come to this wall.
  
 I walk in the river of crisis toward the real,
 I pass guards, finding the center of my fear
 And you, Dick, endlessly my friend during storm.
  
 The arm of flame striking through the wall of form.
  
  
 2  THE ISLAND
  
 Born of this river and this rock island, I relate
 The changes : I born when the whirling snow
 Rained past the general’s grave and the amiable child
 White past the windows of the house of Gyp the Blood.
 General, gangster, child.     I know in myself the island.
  
 I was the island without bridges, the child down whose blazing
 Eye the men of plumes and bone raced their canoes and fire
 Among the building of my young childhood, houses;
 I was those changes, the live darknesses
 Of wood, the pale grain of a grove in the fields 
 Over the river fronting red cliffs across—
 And always surrounding her the river, birdcries, the wild
 Father building his sand, the mother in panic her parks—
 Bridges were thrown across, the girl arose
 From sleeping streams of change in the change city.
 The violent forgetting, the naked sides of darkness.
 Fountain of a city in growth, and island of light and water.
 Snow striking up past the graves, the yellow cry of spring.
  
 Whatever can come to a city can come to this city.
 Under the tall compulsion
                                                    of the past
 I see the city
                           change like a man changing
 I love this man 
                                with my lifelong body of love
 I know you
                         among your changes
                                                                   wherever I go
 Hearing the sounds of building
                                                           the syllables of wrecking
 A young girl watching
                                               the man throwing red hot rivets
 Coals in a bucket of change
 How can you love a city that will not stay?
 I love you
                        like a man of life in change.
  
 Leaves like yesterday shed, the yellow of green spring
 Like today accepted and become one’s self
 I go, I am a city with bridges and tunnels,
 Rock, cloud, ships, voices.     To the man where the river met
 The tracks, now buried deep along the Drive
 Where blossoms like sex pink, dense pink, rose, pink, red.
  
 Towers falling.     A dream of towers.
 Necessity of fountains.     And my poor,
 Stirring among our dreams, 
 Poor of my own spirit, and tribes, hope of towers
 And lives, looking out through my eyes.
 The city the growing body of our hate and love.
 The root of the soul, and war in its black doorways.
 A male sustained cry interrupting nightmare.
 Male flower heading upstream.
  
 Among a city of light, the stone that grows.
 Stigma of dead stone, inert water, the tattered
 Monuments rivetted against flesh.
 Blue noon where the wall made big agonized men
 Stand like sailors pinned howling on their lines, and I
 See stopped in time a crime behind green glass,
 Lilies of all my life on fire.
 Flash faith in a city building its fantasies.
  
 I walk past the guards into my city of change.
  
  
 3  JOURNEY CHANGES
  
 Many of us     Each in his own life waiting
 Waiting to move     Beginning to move     Walking
 And early on the road of the hill of the world
 Come to my landscapes emerging on the grass
  
 The stages of the theatre of the journey
  
 I see the time of willingness between plays
 Waiting and walking and the play of the body
 Silver body with its bosses and places
 One by one touched awakened into into
  
 Touched and turned one by one into     flame
  
 The theatre of the advancing goddess     Blossoming
 Smiles as she stands intensely being in stillness
 Slowness in her blue dress advancing standing I go 
 And far across a field over the jewel grass
  
 The play of the family stroke by stroke acted out
  
 Gestures of deep acknowledging on the journey stages
 Of the playings the play of the goddess and the god
 A supple god of searching and reaching
 Who weaves his strength     Who dances her more alive
  
 The theatre of all animals, my snakes, my great horses
  
 Always the journey     long     patient     many haltings
 Many waitings for choice and again easy breathing
 When the decision to go on is made
 Along the long slopes of choice and again the world
  
 The play of poetry approaching in its solving
  
 Solvings of relations in poems and silences
 For we were born to express     born for a journey
 Caves, theatres, the companioned solitary way
 And then I came to the place of mournful labor
  
 A turn in the road and the long sight from the cliff
  
 Over the scene of the land dug away to nothing and many
 Seen to a stripped horizon carrying barrows of earth
 A hod of earth taken and emptied and thrown away
 Repeated farther than sight.     The voice saying slowly
  
 But it is hell.     I heard my own voice in the words
 Or it could be a foundation     And after the words
 My chance came.     To enter.     The theatres of the world.
  
  
 4  FRAGILE
  
 I think of the image brought into my room
 Of the sage and the thin young man who flickers and asks.
 He is asking about the moment when the Buddha
 Offers the lotus, a flower held out as declaration.
 “Isn’t that fragile?” he asks.     The sage answers:
 “I speak to you.     You speak to me.     Is that fragile?”
  
  
 5  THE LONG BODY
  
 This journey is exploring us. Where the child stood
 An island in a river of crisis, now
 The bridges bind us in symbol, the sea
 Is a bond, the sky reaches into our bodies.
 We pray : we dive into each other’s eyes.
  
 Whatever can come to a woman can come to me.
  
 This is the long body : into life from the beginning,
 Big-headed infant unfolding into child, who stretches and finds
 And then flowing the young one going tall, sunward,
 And now full-grown, held, tense, setting feet to the ground,
 Going as we go in the changes of the body,
 As it is changes, in the long strip of our many
 Shapes, as we range shifting through time.
 The long body : a procession of images.
  
 This moment in a city, in its dream of war.
                                               We chose to be, 
 Becoming the only ones under the trees
                                                                             when the harsh sound
 Of the machine sirens spoke. There were these two men,
 And the bearded one, the boys, the Negro mother feeding
 Her baby. And threats, the ambulance with open doors.
 Now silence. Everyone else within the walls. We sang.
                                We are the living island,
 We the flesh of this island, being lived,
 Whoever knows us is part of us today.
  
 Whatever can happen to anyone can happen to me.
  
 Fire striking its word among us, waterlilies
 Reaching from darkness upward to a sun
 Of rebirth, the implacable.     And in our myth
 The Changing Woman who is still and who offers.
  
 Eyes drinking light, transforming light, this day
 That struggles with itself, brings itself to birth.
 In ways of being, through silence, sources of light
 Arriving behind my eye, a dialogue of light.
  
 And everything a witness of the buried life.
 This moment flowing across the sun, this force
 Of flowers and voices body in body through space.
 The city of endless cycles of the sun.
  
 I speak to you     You speak to me

		<title>The Halls</title>
		<poem_text>Five more books in a box to be carried out to the car;
your office door closes behind you and at that moment
you turn invisible—not even a ghost in that hall
from the hall’s point of view.
If the halls don’t know you, the halls and the rooms
of the buildings where you worked for seven years—
if the halls don’t know you,
                                                               and they don’t—
some new woman or two new men come clattering
down these halls in the month after your departure, indeed
just two days after you left forever
they come clattering with ideas about
the relation between mind and body or will and fate
filled with hormones of being the chosen workers here
and they feel as if the halls and rooms begin to recognize them,
accept them, as if there is a belonging in the world—
 
but these new workers are wrong, the halls don’t know
who is working under the unobtrusive fluorescent panels:
 
this is appalling and for a minute you are appalled
though your being so now is not an event
in the life of your new rented house or even
your new condominium . . .
So if they don’t, if they don’t know you,
the halls, the walls, the fixtures,
then what? Then there is for you
no home in that rock, no home in the mere rock of
where you work, where you briskly walk, not even
in the bed where your body sleeps alone or not—
 
so if there is to be a place for you, for you
it must not be located in plaster and tile and space,
it will have to be in that other house,
the one whose door you felt opening just last night
when you dialed from memory and your friend picked up the phone.</poem_text>

		<title>A Poem for S.</title>
		<poem_text>Because you used to leaf through the dictionary, 
Casually, as someone might in a barber shop, and 
Devotedly, as someone might in a sanctuary,
Each letter would still have your attention if not
For the responsibilities life has tightly fit, like
Gears around the cog of you, like so many petals 
Hinged on a daisy. That’s why I’ll just use your
Initial. Do you know that in one treasured story, a 
Jewish ancestor, horseback in the woods at Yom
Kippur, and stranded without a prayer book, 
Looked into the darkness and realized he had 
Merely to name the alphabet to ask forgiveness—
No congregation of figures needed, he could speak
One letter at a time because all of creation 
Proceeded from those. He fed his horse, and then
Quietly, because it was from his heart, he
Recited them slowly, from aleph to tav. Within those
Sounds, all others were born, all manner of
Trials, actions, emotions, everything needed to
Understand who he was, had been, how flaws
Venerate the human being, how aspirations return
Without spite. Now for you, may your wife’s
X-ray return with good news, may we raise our
Zarfs to both your names in the Great Book of Life.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>As the storm-struck oak leaned closer to the house?—
The remaining six-story half of the tree listing toward the glass box 
Of? the kitchen like someone in the first tilt of stumbling?—
The other half crashed into the neighbors’ yards, a massive
Diagonal for which we had no visual cue save for 
An antler dropped by a constellation?—
As the ragged half ??leaned nearer, the second storm of cloying snow 
Began pulling on the shocked, still-looming splitting, and its branches dragged 
Lower like ripped hems it was tripping over
Until they rustled on the roof under which I
Quickly made dinner, each noise a threat from a body under which we so recently 
Said, Thank goodness for our tree, how it has accompanied us all these years,
Thank goodness for its recitation of the seasons out our windows and over
The little lot of our yard, thank goodness for the birdsong and ?squirrel games 
Which keep us from living alone, and for its proffered shade, the crack of the bat
Resounding through September when its dime-sized acorns 
Land on the tin awning next door. Have
Mercy on us, you, the massively beautiful, now ravaged and charged
With destruction.
We did speak like that. As if from a book of psalms
Because it took up the sky</poem_text>

How deep does that go?

		<title>Song of the Shattering Vessels</title>
		<poem_text>Either the world is coming together,
or else the world is falling apart?—
     here?—?now?—?along these letters,
     against the walls of every heart. 
Today, tomorrow, within its weather,
the end or beginning’s about to start?—
     the world impossibly coming together
     or very possibly falling apart.
Now the lovers’ mouths are open?—
maybe the miracle’s about to start:
      the world within us coming together,
      because all around us it’s falling apart. 
Even as they speak, he wonders,
even as the fear departs:
     Is that the world coming together?
     Can they keep it from falling apart?
The image, gradually, is growing sharper;
now the sound is like a dart:
     It seemed their world was coming together,
     but in fact it was falling apart.
That’s the nightmare, that’s the terror,
that’s the Isaac of this art?—
     which sees that the world might come together
      if only we’re willing to take it apart. 
The dream, the lure, is the prayer’s answer,
which can’t be plotted on any chart?—
    as we know the world that’s coming together
    without our knowing is falling apart.</poem_text>

		<title>The Fury That Breaks</title>
		<poem_text>After César Vallejo
					The fury that breaks a grown-up into kids,
a kid into scattered birds
and a bird into limp eggs,
the fury of the poor
takes one part oil to two parts vinegar.
The fury that breaks a tree into leaves,
a leaf into deranged flowers
and a flower into wilting telescopes,
the fury of the poor
gushes two rivers against a hundred seas.
The fury that breaks the true into doubts,
doubt into three matching arches
and the arch into instant tombs,
the fury of the poor
draws a sharpening stone against two knives.
The fury that breaks the soul into bodies,
the body into warped organs,
and the organ into eight doctrines,
the fury of the poor
burns with one fire in two thousand craters.</poem_text>

City of sad foghorns and clapboard ziggurats,

There was some plan to use the door as a jetty

		<title>On Gardens</title>
		<poem_text>When I read about the garden
designed to bloom only white flowers,
I think about the Spanish friar who saw one
of my grandmothers, two hundred years 
removed, and fucked her. If you look 
at the word colony far enough, you see it
traveling back to the Latin
of? inhabit, till, and cultivate. Words 
that would have meant something
to the friar, walking among the village girls
as though in a field of flowers, knowing
that fucking was one way of?? having
a foreign policy. As I write this, there’s snow
falling, which means that every
angry thought is as short-lived as a match.
The night is its own white garden:
snow on the fence, snow on the tree
stump, snow on the azalea bushes,
their leaves hanging down like green
bats from the branches. I know it’s not fair
to see qualities of injustice in the aesthetics
of a garden, but somewhere between
what the eye sees and what the mind thinks 
is the world, landscapes mangled
into sentences, one color read into rage.
When the neighbors complained
the roots of our cypress were buckling
their lot, my landlord cut the tree down.
I didn’t know a living thing three stories high
could be so silent, until it was gone.
Suddenly that sky. Suddenly all the light
in the windows, as though every sheet
of glass was having a migraine.
When I think about that grandmother 
whose name I don’t even know, I think of
what it would mean to make a garden
that blooms black: peonies and gladiolas
of deepest purple, tulips like ravens.
Or a garden that doesn’t bloom at all: rocks
poised on clean gravel. When the snow stops,
I walk to see the quiet that has colonized
everything. The main street is asleep, except
for the bus that goes by, bright as a cruise ship. 
There are sheet cakes of? snow on top
of cars. In front of?? houses, each lawn
is as clean as paper, except where the first cat
or raccoon has walked across, each track
like a barbed-wire sash on a white gown.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>I have seen the black sheets laid out like carpets
under the trees, catching the rain
of? olives as they fell. Also the cerulean brightness
of ??the one covering the bad roof
of? a neighbor’s shed, the color the only color 
inside the winter’s weeks. Another one
took the shape of?? the pile of?? bricks underneath.
Another flew off the back of a truck,
black as a piano if a piano could rise into the air.
I have seen the ones under bridges,
the forms they make of sleep. I could go on
this way until the end of the page, even though 
what I have in my mind isn’t the thing
itself, but the category of?? belief that sees the thing 
as a shelter for what is beneath it.
There is no shelter. You cannot put a tarp over
a wave. You cannot put a tarp
over a war. You cannot put a tarp over the broken
oil well miles under the ocean. 
There is no tarp for that raging figure in the mind
that sits in a corner and shreds receipts
and newspapers. There is no tarp for dread,
whose only recourse is language
so approximate it hardly means what it means:
He is not here. She is sick. She cannot remember
her name. He is old. He is ashamed.</poem_text>

To the finest, fairest rear of their time.
Which tail forged ahead? Which bottom’s true fame
Topped? Which back was in front, which terce most prime?
A judge chose the elder girl’s back matter;
Her finish was more fine and far matter.
She got the prize, and his heart; soon they wed.
“But the younger’s sitter’s not a smatter
Less meet; I’ll marry her,” his brother said.
It went so well, their joys were so perfected,
That after them a temple was erected
In honor of? Venus Callipygus.
No other church?—?though I don’t know its rite?—
Could so, from head to epididymis,
Move me with deep devotion to its site.

		<poem_text>Fine bitches all, and Molly Dance???...               —?Djuna Barnes
					Come for duty’s sake (as girls do) we watch
The sly very old woman wile away from her pious
And stagger-blind friend, their daily split of gin.
She pours big drinks. We think of what
Has crumpled, folded, slumped her flesh in
And muddied her once tumbling blood that, young,
Sped her, threaded with brave power: a Tower,
Now Babel, then of? ivory, of? the Shulamite,
Collapsed to this keen dame moving among
Herself. She hums, she plays with used bright
Ghosts, makes real dolls, and drinking sings Come here
My child, and feel it, dear. A crooking finger
Shows how hot the oven is.
(Also she is alive with hate.
Also she is afraid of? hell. Also, we wish
We might, illiberal, uncompassionate,
Run from her smell, her teeth in the dish.)
Even dying, her life riots in her. We stand stock still
Though aswarm with itches under her disreputable smiles.
We manage to mean well. We endure, and more.
We learn time’s pleasure, catch our future and its cure.
We’re dear blood daughters to this every hag, and near kin
To any after this of? those our mirrors tell us foolishly envy us,
Presuming us, who are young, to be beautiful, kind, and sure.

     when a hawk snatched its mate. It perched, rushed
     notes fluting two life-quotas in one flood,
     its lungs pushing its voice, flushing the keen
     calls, pumped out as the heart pumps blood,
     not in twilight or warning but noon &amp; wrong,
     its old notes whistled too fast but accurate.

You can’t. So don’t try.
Lust, pride, and lethargy

The meanest mistake
has a point to make.
Hear this?— 
what his vintner d’Eyquem said
once the lord d’Eyquem was dead:
         “The wine that year promised bad or none.
          He’d let it go too late.
          Rot had crawled through all the vines,
          greasy scum on every cluster
          dangling at the crotches of the leaves.
          Should have been long picked
          but he’d said, ‘No. Wait for me,’
          off to wait on a new woman,
          grapes on the verge of ripe
          when he left. Coupling kept him
          till rot wrapped the grapes like lace
          &amp; by the time she’d kicked him out
          the sun had got them, they hung
          shriveled in the blast.
          Well, he rode home cocky
          &amp; bullied the grapes into the vats
          rot &amp; all, spoiled grapes, too old,
          too soon squeezed dry.
                                                     The wine makes.
          The wine makes thick, gold-colored,
          &amp; pours like honey.
          We try it. Fantastic!
         not like honey, punchy,
         you’ve never drunk anything like it?— 
         refreshing, in a rush
         over a heat that slows your throat?—
         wanting to keep that flavor
         stuck to the edge of your tongue
         where your taste is, keep it
         like the best bouquet you can remember
         of sundown summer &amp; someone coming
         to you smiling. The taste has odor
         like a new country, so fine
         at first you can’t take it in
         it’s so strange. It’s beautiful
         &amp; believe me you love to go slow.”

drove him mad. It was the breaking of boundaries, 
the sudden invasion, but not only that it was 
the sharing of food and the sharing of space; he didn&#39;t 
run into an alley or into a cellar, 
he sat beside me, eating, and I didn&#39;t run 
into a trattoria, say, shaking, 
with food on my lips and blood on my cheek, sobbing; 
but not only that, I had gone there to eat 
and wait for someone. I had maybe an hour 
before she would come and I was full of hope 
and excitement. I have resisted for years 
interpreting this, but now I think I was given 
a clue, or I was giving myself a clue, 
across the street from the glass sandwich shop. 
That was my last night with her, the next day 
I would leave on the train for Paris and she would 
meet her husband. Thirty-five years ago 
I ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms, we were 
dying together; we never met again 
although she was pregnant when I left her—I have 
a daughter or son somewhere, darling grandchildren 
in Norwich, Connecticut, or Canton, Ohio. 
Every five years I think about her again 
and plan on looking her up. The last time 
I was sitting in New Brunswick, New Jersey, 
and heard that her husband was teaching at Princeton, 
if she was still married, or still alive, and tried 
calling. I went that far. We lived 
in Florence and Rome. We rowed in the bay of Naples 
and floated, naked, on the boards. I started 
to think of her again today. I still 
am horrified by the cat&#39;s hunger. I still 
am puzzled by the connection. This is another 
insane devotion, there must be hundreds, although 
it isn&#39;t just that, there is no pain, and the thought 
is fleeting and sweet. I think it&#39;s my own dumb boyhood, 
walking around with Slavic cheeks and burning 
stupid eyes. I think I gave the cat 
half of my sandwich to buy my life, I think 
I broke it in half as a decent sacrifice. 
It was this I bought, the red coleus, 
the split rocking chair, the silk lampshade. 
Happiness. I watched him with pleasure. 
I bought memory. I could have lost it. 
How crazy it sounds. His face twisted with cunning. 
The wind blowing through his hair. His jaw working.</poem_text>

		<title>Box of Cigars</title>
		<poem_text>I tried one or two but they were stale 
and broke like sticks or crumbled when I rolled them 
and lighting a match was useless nor could I 
put them back in the refrigerator— 
it was too late for that—even licking them 
filled my mouth with ground-up outer leaf, 
product of Lancaster or eastern Virginia, 
so schooled I am with cigars, it comes in the blood, 
and I threw handfuls of them into the street 
from three floors up and, to my horror, sitting 
on my stoop were four or five street people 
who ran to catch them as if they were suddenly rich, 
and I apologize for that, no one should 
be degraded that way, my hands were crazy, 
and I ran down to explain but they were smoking 
already nor did I have anything to give them 
since we were living on beans ourselves, I sat 
and smoked too, and once in a while we looked 
up at the open window, and one of us spit 
into his empty can. We were visionaries.</poem_text>

		<title>Testimonial</title>
		<poem_text>Back when the earth was new 
and heaven just a whisper, 
back when the names of things 
hadn&#39;t had time to stick; 
back when the smallest breezes 
melted summer into autumn, 
when all the poplars quivered 
sweetly in rank and file . . . 
the world called, and I answered. 
Each glance ignited to a gaze. 
I caught my breath and called that life, 
swooned between spoonfuls of lemon sorbet. 
I was pirouette and flourish, 
I was filigree and flame. 
How could I count my blessings 
when I didn&#39;t know their names? 
Back when everything was still to come, 
luck leaked out everywhere. 
I gave my promise to the world, 
and the world followed me here.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>What could have been the big to-do 
that caused him to push me aside 
on that platform? Was a woman who knew 
there must be some good even inside 
an ass like him on board that train? 
Charity? Frances? His last chance 
in a ratty string of last chances? Jane? 
Surely in all of us is some good. 
Better love thy neighbor, buddy, 
lest she shove back. Maybe I should. 
It&#39;s probably just a cruddy 
downtown interview leading to 
some cheap-tie, careerist, dull 
cul-de-sac he&#39;s speeding to. 
Can he catch up with his soul? 
Really, what was the freaking crisis? 
Did he need to know before me 
if the lights searching the crowd&#39;s eyes 
were those of our train, or maybe 
the train of who he might have been, 
the person his own-heart-numbing, 
me-shoving anxiety about being 
prevents him from ever becoming? 
How has his thoughtlessness defiled 
who I was before he shoved me? 
How might I be smiling now if he&#39;d smiled, 
hanging back, as though he might have loved me?</poem_text>

		<title>Candles</title>
		<poem_text>If on your grandmother&#39;s birthday you burn a candle   
To honor her memory, you might think of burning an extra   
To honor the memory of someone who never met her,   
A man who may have come to the town she lived in   
Looking for work and never found it.   
Picture him taking a stroll one morning,   
After a month of grief with the want ads,   
To refresh himself in the park before moving on.   
Suppose he notices on the gravel path the shards   
Of a green glass bottle that your grandmother,   
Then still a girl, will be destined to step on   
When she wanders barefoot away from her school picnic   
If he doesn&#39;t stoop down and scoop the mess up   
With the want-ad section and carry it to a trash can.   
For you to burn a candle for him   
You needn&#39;t suppose the cut would be a deep one,   
Just deep enough to keep her at home   
The night of the hay ride when she meets Helen,   
Who is soon to become her dearest friend,   
Whose brother George, thirty years later,   
Helps your grandfather with a loan so his shoe store   
Doesn&#39;t go under in the Great Depression   
And his son, your father, is able to stay in school   
Where his love of learning is fanned into flames,   
A love he labors, later, to kindle in you.   
How grateful you are for your father&#39;s efforts   
Is shown by the candles you&#39;ve burned for him.   
But today, for a change, why not a candle   
For the man whose name is unknown to you?   
Take a moment to wonder whether he died at home   
With friends and family or alone on the road,   
On the look-out for no one to sit at his bedside   
And hold his hand, the very hand   
It&#39;s time for you to imagine holding.</poem_text>

		<poem_text>We here at Progressive Health would like to thank you   
For being one of the generous few who&#39;ve promised   
To bequeath your vital organs to whoever needs them.   
Now we&#39;d like to give you the opportunity   
To step out far in front of the other donors   
By acting a little sooner than you expected,   
Tomorrow, to be precise, the day you&#39;re scheduled   
To come in for your yearly physical. Six patients   
Are waiting this very minute in intensive care   
Who will likely die before another liver   
And spleen and pairs of lungs and kidneys   
Match theirs as closely as yours do. Twenty years,   
Maybe more, are left you, granted, but the gain   
Of these patients might total more than a century.   
To you, of course, one year of your life means more   
Than six of theirs, but to no one else,   
No one as concerned with the general welfare   
As you&#39;ve claimed to be. As for your poems— 
The few you may have it in you to finish— 
Even if we don&#39;t judge them by those you&#39;ve written,   
Even if we assume you finally stage a breakthrough,   
It&#39;s doubtful they&#39;ll raise one Lazarus from a grave   
Metaphoric or literal. But your body is guaranteed   
To work six wonders. As for the gaps you&#39;ll leave   
As an aging bachelor in the life of friends,   
They&#39;ll close far sooner than the open wounds   
Soon to be left in the hearts of husbands and wives,   
Parents and children, by the death of the six   
Who now are failing. Just imagine how grateful   
They&#39;ll all be when they hear of your grand gesture.   
Summer and winter they&#39;ll visit your grave, in shifts,   
For as long as they live, and stoop to tend it,   
And leave it adorned with flowers or holly wreaths,   
While your friends, who are just as forgetful   
As you are, just as liable to be distracted,   
Will do no more than a makeshift job of upkeep.   
If the people you&#39;ll see tomorrow pacing the halls   
Of our crowded facility don&#39;t move you enough,   
They&#39;ll make you at least uneasy. No happy future   
Is likely in store for a man like you whose conscience   
Will ask him to certify every hour from now on   
Six times as full as it was before, your work   
Six times as strenuous, your walks in the woods   
Six times as restorative as anyone else&#39;s.   
Why be a drudge, staggering to the end of your life   
Under this crushing burden when, with a single word,   
You could be a god, one of the few gods   
Who, when called on, really listens?</poem_text>

		<title>A Momentary Longing To Hear Sad Advice from One Long Dead</title>
		<poem_text>Who was my teacher at Harvard. Did not wear overcoat 
Saying to me as we walked across the Yard 
Cold brittle autumn is you should be wearing overcoat. I said 
You are not wearing overcoat. He said, 
You should do as I say not do as I do. 
Just how American it was and how late Forties it was 
Delmore, but not I, was probably aware. He quoted Finnegans Wake to me 
In his New York apartment sitting on chair 
Table directly in front of him. There did he write? I am wondering. 
Look at this photograph said of his mother and father. 
Coney Island. Do they look happy? He couldn&#39;t figure it out. 
Believed Pogo to be at the limits of our culture. 
Pogo. Walt Kelly must have read Joyce Delmore said. 
Why don&#39;t you ask him? 
Why don&#39;t you ask Walt Kelly if he read Finnegans Wake or not. 
Your parents don&#39;t look happy but it is just a photograph. 
Maybe they felt awkward posing for photographs. 
Maybe it is just a bad photograph. Delmore is not listening 
I want to hear him tell me something sad but however true. 
Delmore in his tomb is sitting. People say yes everyone is dying 
But here read this happy book on the subject. Not Delmore. Not that rueful man.</poem_text>

		<title>Kindness</title>
		<poem_text>For Carol Rigolot
					I acknowledge my status as a stranger:
       When deeds splay before us 
precious as gold &amp; unused chances 
stripped from the whine-bone, 
we know the moment kindheartedness 
walks in. Each praise be 
echoes us back as the years uncount 
themselves, eating salt. Though blood 
first shaped us on the climbing wheel, 
the human mind lit by the savanna’s 
ice star &amp; thistle rose, 
your knowing gaze enters a room 
&amp; opens the day, 
saying we were made for fun. 
Even the bedazzled brute knows 
when sunlight falls through leaves 
across honed knives on the table. 
If we can see it push shadows 
aside, growing closer, are we less 
broken? A barometer, temperature 
gauge, a ruler in minus fractions 
&amp; pedigrees, a thingmajig, 
a probe with an all-seeing eye, 
what do we need to measure 
kindness, every unheld breath, 
every unkind leapyear? 
Sometimes a sober voice is enough 
to calm the waters &amp; drive away 
the false witnesses, saying, Look, 
here are the broken treaties Beauty 
brought to us earthbound sentinels.</poem_text>

		<title>Leave-Taking</title>
		<poem_text>I do not know where either of us can turn 
Just at first, waking from the sleep of each other. 
I do not know how we can bear 
The river struck by the gold plummet of the moon, 
Or many trees shaken together in the darkness. 
We shall wish not to be alone 
And that love were not dispersed and set free— 
Though you defeat me, 
And I be heavy upon you. 
But like earth heaped over the heart 
Is love grown perfect. 
Like a shell over the beat of life 
Is love perfect to the last. 
So let it be the same 
Whether we turn to the dark or to the kiss of another; 
Let us know this for leavetaking, 
That I may not be heavy upon you, 
That you may blind me no more.</poem_text>
